**Notes**
=====

1. Make sure "data" folder have "nato" and "world-cup" folder and the associated data files
2. Make sure you have "bin" and "src" folder
3. Go to "src" folder and run following commands:

    -make
    -make install
4. This code implements following paper:
    Paudel R, Kandel P, Eberle W. Detecting Spam Tweets in Trending Topics using Graph-Based Approach. (2019 March)
5. The implementation for ï»¿Boididou et al. is done using the source code available in their [github repository](https://github.com/MKLab-ITI/computational-verification)

**Description**
This code generate graphs from Tweets and News, run graph-based anomaly detection tool on the generated graph for spam detection.
Also, it implement following three baseline approaches used in the paper for performance comparision.:
+ Benevenuto et al.
+ Chen et al. and
+ Anantharam et al.
The result of the experiment is shown in following table. Our graph-based approach was superior to all 4 baseline approaches in terms of recall and f1-score.
