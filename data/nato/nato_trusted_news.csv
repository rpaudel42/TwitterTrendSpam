Win McNamee/Getty Images Republican Sen. John McCain slammed his GOP colleague, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, on Wednesday after Paul blocked the passage of a treaty that would allow Montenegro to move forward with joining NATO, Defense News' Joe Gould reported.  McCain warned before the vote that ""If there's objection, you are achieving the objectives of Vladimir Putin...and I do not say that lightly.""  Paul then entered the Senate chamber, voted against the accession protocol, and exited.  ""The only conclusion you can draw when he walks away is he has no argument to be made,"" McCain said after Paul walked out abruptly, according to The Washington Examiner. ""The senator from Kentucky is now working for Vladimir Putin.""  Russian President Vladimir Putin is staunchly opposed to Montengro's accession to NATO, which he views as a threat to Russian sovereignty. Albania and Croatia joined the alliance 2009.  ""Senator McCain believes that the person who benefits the most from Congress's failure to ratify Montenegro's ascension to NATO is Vladimir Putin, whose government has sought to destroy the NATO alliance, erode confidence in America's commitments to its allies, overthrow the duly-elected government of Montenegro, and undermine democratic institutions throughout Europe,"" McCain's spokesperson, Julie Tarallo, told Business Insider on Wednesday.  ""The overwhelming majority of senators who support this treaty, and certainly the people of Montenegro, deserved an explanation from Senator Paul on the Senate floor as to why he sought to prevent this small, brave country from joining in the defense of the free world,"" Tarallo added.  For Montenegro to move forward with the accession process, which was approved in May, the treaty has to be ratified by the US Senate by unanimous consent. Twenty-one of 28 NATO allies have already backed Montenegro's accession.  Asked about McCain's comment, Paul stood by his decision to block the treaty and said it would be ""unwise to expand the monetary and military obligations of the United States given the burden of our $20 trillion debt.""  ""Currently, the United States has troops in dozens of countries and is actively fighting in Iraq, Syria, Libya, and Yemen (with the occasional drone strike in Pakistan),"" Paul told Business Insider in a statement provided by his office. ""In addition, the United States is pledged to defend 28 countries in NATO.""  McCain promised Montenegro Prime Minister Dusko Markovic in January that the Senate would ratify the treaty soon, according to Radio Free Europe.  Markovic was the target of a coup plot, allegedly orchestrated by Russian intelligence agents, to overthrow Montenegro's pro-NATO government and replace it with a Russia-friendly regime, The New York Times reported. The plot was uncovered in November after the pro-Russian mercenary who helped organize it was arrested by Montenegrin police."

He insisted on sharing before the cameras imaginary facts that hadn_„Žt a thing to do with the summit agenda, and he refused to listen to anyone who tried, however gently, to correct him. In the words of Robert Kagan, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, _„ñThese are not negotiating tactics. They are the tactics of someone who does not want a deal._„ In a private meeting, Donald Trump reportedly threatened that unless the allies boosted their military spending beyond previous agreements by January, the United States would _„ñgo it alone._„ Nicholas Burns, a former U.S. ambassador to NATO, implored Americans not to _„ñnormalize_„ this. _„ñHe is the first American president since Harry Truman,_„ Burns noted, _„ñto not believe that NATO is central to American national security interests._„ And Burns is a Republican.  Trump_„Žs NATO-bashing surprised no one. He has repeatedly suggested the United States_„Ž postwar security architecture is a _„ñbad deal,_„ one negotiated by weak and foolish _„ñincompetents._„ Foreign policy, in his view, is a zero-sum game; any benefit to another nation must of necessity be a loss for the United States. _„ñNATO countries,_„ he declared on Twitter, _„ñmust pay MORE, the United States must pay LESS. Very Unfair!_„  Story Continued Below  Unfair? A world that revolves around American military, economic and cultural power, and uses the U.S. dollar as its reserve currency?  What Trump fails to understand is that the disparity in spending, with the U.S. paying more than its allies, is not a bug of the system. It is a feature. This is how the great postwar statesmen designed it, and this immensely foresighted strategy has ensured the absence of great power conflict_„îand nuclear war_„îfor three-quarters of a century.  The open, liberal world order we know today was built in the wake of World War II and expanded after the collapse of the Soviet Union. By design, it is led by the United States; by design, it ensures permanent U.S. military hegemony over Eurasia while uniting Europe under the U.S._„Ž protection. The goal of this American grand strategy is to prevent any single power from dominating the region and turning on the United States and its allies. American hegemony serves, too, to quell previously intractable regional rivalries, preventing further world wars. Dean Acheson, George Marshall and the other great statesmen of their generation pursued this strategy because they had learned, at unimaginable cost, that the eternal American fantasy of forever being free of Europe_„îisolationism, or America Firstism, in other words_„îwas just that: a fantasy. Four hundred thousand American men lost their lives in the European theaters of the First and Second World Wars. (American fatalities in all of the other 20th-century conflicts_„îincluding Vietnam, Korea and the Persian Gulf_„îdo not total one-quarter of that number.) Our postwar statesmen were neither weak nor incompetent. They were the architects of the greatest foreign policy triumph in U.S. history.  So successful was this policy that Americans now_„îmost of whom weren_„Žt alive to witness the enormity of these wars_„îsee peace, unity, prosperity and stability as Europe_„Žs natural state. This is an illusion. For centuries, Europe was the fulcrum of global violence. With the age of global exploration, it became the globe_„Žs primary exporter of violence, the tempo and horror of the carnage rising every century with improvements in technology for violence. The Scramble for Africa, the division and colonization of that continent by Europe, is a case in point. The 1884-85 Berlin West Africa Conference, which assembled the representatives of 13 European powers to settle their colonial claims to Africa by diplomacy in place of arms, did lead to peace in Europe for several years. Africans, however, would not recall these years for their exceptional comity. For example, the conference indulged King LÍ©opold II_„Žs claim that the Congo Free State was his private property. Ten million Congolese souls perished under his ministrations.  In recognizing this history of blood, however, we must recognize something equally true: In the wake of World War II, liberal democracy saw its fullest realization in the West. This flourishing of peace and human rights cannot be explained by a sudden outbreak of European pacifism. (Consider the 1956 Suez expedition, crushed by an infuriated President Dwight Eisenhower; or the 1954-62 Franco-Algerian War.) It happened because during World War II, Europe destroyed itself, leaving the United States overwhelmingly powerful by comparison, its only rival the Soviet Union. Through the application of economic, diplomatic and military force majeure, the United States suppressed Europe_„Žs internal security competition. This is why postwar Europe ceased to be the world_„Žs leading exporter of violence and became, instead, the world_„Žs leading exporter of luxury sedans.  Only America, and massive power as the U.S. exercised it, could have pacified and unified Europe under its aegis. No other continental country possessed half the world_„Žs GDP. No other country had enough distance from Europe to be trusted, to a large extent, by all parties and indifferent to its regional jealousies. No other country had a strategic, moral and economic vision for Europe that its inhabitants could be persuaded gladly to share.  Indeed, Europeans cooperated with the U.S. program because it created conditions under which both the United States and Europe flourished. The United States assisted Europe_„Žs postwar economic recovery with $13 billion of aid in the form of the Marshall Plan. (In today_„Žs dollars, roughly $113 billion.) It midwifed the groupings and treaties that would become the European Union. It brought Europe under the U.S. security umbrella with the NATO treaty. Article V of the treaty, its most important element, declares that an attack on one member of NATO is an attack on all members. These policies were intended not only to counter the Soviet Union, but to condition Europe_„Žs prosperity upon its integration into a single market, with free movement of goods, capital and labor. The founders of these institutions fully intended them to be the foundations of a United States of Europe, much like the United States of America. Profound economic interdependence, they believed, would make further European wars impossible.  At the same time, the United States built an open, global order upon an architecture of specific institutions: the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund and the International Court of Justice. This order is in many respects an empire_„îa Pax Americana_„îbut it is more humane than any empire that preceded it, with institutions that are intended to benefit all parties. Postwar U.S. statesmen believed that prosperous, liberal democracies that traded freely with each other would neither go to war with each other nor the United States. They ascribed, in other words, to the so-called Democratic Peace theory_„îa theory with overwhelming empirical support.  The U.S. military was always an integral part of the plan to unite and rebuild Europe from the rubble. Since World War II, U.S. troops have been deployed in Eurasia to ensure the continent cannot be dominated by a single power capable of monopolizing its resources and turning them against the U.S. The United States has built overwhelmingly massive military assets there to deter local arms races before they begin, and it has simultaneously assured those under U.S. protection that there is no need to begin local arms races, for their safety is guaranteed. American grand strategy rests upon the credibility of its promise to protect American allies; this credibility rests, in turn, upon U.S. willingness to display its commitment. (The Berlin Airlift, when U.S. troops airlifted supplies to Berlin during a Soviet blockade, was precisely such a display.) In return for the United States_„Ž commitment, U.S. allies have accepted America_„Žs dominant role in the international system.  In the postwar era, just as now, the enemies of liberal democracy sought to undermine the order the U.S. was building. Precisely because the Marshall Plan would strengthen and unite the West under the United States_„Ž protection, the Soviet Union_„Žs propaganda organs cranked into overdrive to denounce it. A cartoon, for example, published in Isvestia in 1949, depicted the Marshall Plan_„Žs administrator, Paul Hoffman, as a fat capitalist bent on destroying the sovereignty of European nations. The French paper L'HumanitÍ©, which reliably parroted Moscow_„Žs line, wrote, _„ñAfter disorganizing the national economies of the countries which are under the American yoke, American leaders now intend conclusively to subjugate the economy of these countries to their own interests._„  The Soviet Union_„Žs criticism of the Marshall Plan and other American involvement in Europe was eerily similar to the language Russia_„Žs now uses in its campaign to undermine NATO and the EU. The vocabulary and tropes of Russian propaganda are widely echoed, wittingly or unwittingly, by far-right, far-left and other antiliberal politicians, parties and movements throughout the West. With the men who built the postwar world order now in their graves, and the memory of carnage and horror buried with them, a very sizable constituency of Americans has forgotten that their country built this system for a reason_„îthat the United States does not maintain its alliances as an act of foolish largesse. The loudest exponent of the idea that the U.S. is getting rolled, that the European Union was _„ñcreated to destroy us,_„ and that multilateral institutions such as the World Trade Organization assault the _„ñsovereignty_„ of the nations concerned is, unfortunately, the president of the United States.  It_„Žs hard to understate how foolish and reckless these notions are. History can be shoved down the memory hole, for a time, but reality is never so cooperative. Global free trade sustains modern economic life. An interruption to this trade_„îcarried out chiefly on global shipping lanes safeguarded by the U.S. military_„îwould bring modern life to an end. The Second World War proved not only that isolationism and American-Firstism were fantasies, but exceptionally childish and dangerous ones, at that. In the age of hyperglobalized trade, international air travel, the internet, nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles, these fantasies are even more childish and dangerous. The U.S. may be on another continent, but it is not on another planet.  It is true that the U.S. spends more on its military, in absolute dollars and as a percentage of GDP, than any European country. That was always part of the deal. The U.S. is a global superpower. It can fight a war anywhere in the world, invade any country at will, and (at least in theory) fight multiple simultaneous major wars_„îeven in space. Of course this costs more. It is in America_„Žs advantage to be the only power on the planet that can do this.  Conversely, it is not remotely in America_„Žs advantage for other countries to spend as much money on their militaries as we do. Europe is America_„Žs biggest export market, as designed. We want Europeans to spend their money enjoying U.S. goods and services, not razing Flanders to the ground yet again.  Yet Trump_„Žs refusal to deter our shared enemies and protect our allies risks provoking a regional European arms race_„îexactly what the U.S. has sought to avoid for 74 years. It is an invitation to adventurism from Putin. Trump_„Žs refusal to adopt the encouraging language of past presidents toward European integration, language that until now has been transformed into policy by professional and experienced State Department employees, puts further strain on an already-weakened Europe. Above all, Trump_„Žs overt support for sordid, Kremlin-backed actors who seek to undermine Europe_„Žs unity is unfathomable: How could it be in Europe_„Žs interest, or in ours, for the American president to lend the United States_„Ž prestige and support to Europe_„Žs Nazis, neo-Nazis, doctrinal Marxists, populists, authoritarians, and ethnic supremacists, particularly since all of them are ideologically hostile to the United States?  The damage Trump has deliberately inflicted on Europe_„Žs stability comes at a uniquely dangerous time. Democracy_„Žs so-called third wave_„îthe global blossoming of open political systems after the Cold War_„îhas long since receded. A threat to liberal democracy, in the form of a distinct, rival ideology_„îilliberal democracy_„îis ascendant. We see it today in Russia and Turkey_„îa corrupt, oligarchic, kleptocratic and hollow form of democracy that spreads and consolidates itself through the new technologies of the 21st century.  The global order the U.S. built was based on the principle that only a world of liberal democracies can be peaceful and prosperous. That principle is correct. Should the unraveling of the order the U.S. built proceed at this pace, the world will soon be neither peaceful nor prosperous. Nor will the effects be confined to regions distant from the United States. America will feel them gradually, and then, probably, overnight_„îin the form of a devastating, sudden shock.  Charles de Gaulle believed the Anglophone world could not, in the long term, be trusted with French security. It led him to withdraw France from NATO_„Žs military integrated command and launch an independent nuclear development program. The independent nuclear program was real, but the withdrawal from NATO wasn_„Žt_„îa secret agreement kept France in NATO anyway. But, today, with other NATO members obliged to consider the costs and benefits of an independent accommodation with Russia and the risks and rewards of acquiring an independent nuclear deterrent, de Gaulle is saying from the grave, I told you so.  The American-led world order, undergirded by the ideal of liberal democracy, has been highly imperfect. But it has been the closest thing to Utopia our fallen and benighted species has ever seen. Its benefits are not just economic, although those benefits are immense. Its benefits must be measured in wars not fought, lives not squandered.  Yet many Americans have turned their backs on history and reality alike. Let us hope pride does not prevent them from realizing this mistake before it_„Žs far too late.  Claire Berlinski lives in Paris. Her forthcoming book, The New Caesars and the Death of Democracy in the West, is entirely crowdfunded. She would be grateful for your support."

Trump will press for more European defense spending at this week_„Žs meeting, which is likely to be contentious. Other NATO members are already pushing back, arguing that their commitment to defense is rising and they back US priorities in other important ways. But the basic numbers support Trump.  The United States has been the biggest contributor to NATO since Western nations founded the alliance in 1949 to help prevent any more world wars and shield Europe from the Soviet Union. Underpayments by European nations have been contentious since long before Trump started complaining about the problem_„_especially following the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, when many nations began to slash defense spending.  In 2014, NATO agreed that each member country should spend a minimum of 2% of GDP on defense within a decade. So far, only five countries meet that threshold: the United States, the United Kingdom, Greece, Estonia and Latvia. The United States spends 3.5% of GDP on defense, the most of any NATO member. Among other big NATO members, France spends 1.8% of GDP on defense, Germany 1.2%, Italy 1.2%, and Spain 0.9%.  NATO has 29 member countries. Here_„Žs how they measure up:  Graphic by David Foster More  NATO said earlier this year that eight members will meet the 2% threshold in 2018, with Poland, Romania, and Lithuania joining the club. The alliance also said 15 nations would hit the target by 2024, though it hasn_„Žt identified the other seven. That would still leave 14 members falling short of NATO_„Žs own spending target. And that_„Žs if there_„Žs no recession by then, which could force governments to cut spending, not raise it, as tax revenue declines.  European leaders seem to realize they have a weak argument when Trump blasts them for subpar defense spending. Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, argued in a statement prior to Trump_„Žs visit that Europe spends more on defense than China and Russia, and he urged Trump to _„ñappreciate your allies._„ But he also acknowledged that Trump is right on spending, saying _„ñdear Europe, spend more on your defence, because everyone respects an ally that is well-prepared and equipped._„  While Trump is right about the spending numbers, some analysts worry he_„Žs overly fixated on one metric that doesn_„Žt fully capture the way various NATO members contribute to real-world security operations. Also important, for instance, are troop and equipment contributions to NATO missions. By those metrics, some of the deadbeat members look much more involved.  NATO members other than the United States have taken on steadily more of the NATO mission in Afghanistan since the US first invaded in 2001, for instance. Seven nations_„îthe Czech Republic, Romania, Montenegro, Albania, Denmark, Croatia and Germany_„îcontributed more troops to Afghanistan operations, as a percentage of their total military force, than the United States did between 2015 and 2017, according to analysis by the Center for Strategic and International Studies.  By the same metric, nine NATO members, led by Canada, Norway and Denmark, contributed a larger portion of their military force to operations against ISIS than the US did in 2016. And the US ranks 18th in refugees taken in due to Mideast instability as a percentage of total population, with Turkey, Sweden and Norway accepting the most."

And in every case so far, the West has bounced back.  Could this time prove different? Perhaps. But there are good reasons to believe that this too shall pass. At the very least, it_„Žs useful to situate the current tempest within the context of past storms that have swept across the Atlantic. The point of reviewing this history isn_„Žt to diminish the seriousness of the present rift or to encourage complacency. But it does offer an important corrective to the doom and despondency about the future of the West_„îincreasingly heard among foreign-policy thinkers on both sides of the Atlantic_„îas well as the counterproductive amnesia that overlooks just how much we_„Žve already gotten through together.  The first major breach in postwar transatlantic relations took place in 1956, when Britain and France, together with Israel, attempted to seize control of the Suez Canal from Egypt. Even though it was the height of the Cold War, President Dwight Eisenhower not only vociferously criticized the military gamble by London and Paris, but actually aligned with the Soviet Union at the UN Security Council to demand the removal of their forces. Anticipating a French and British veto, Washington then took its case to the General Assembly, where it again linked up with Moscow to pass an even stronger resolution. Eisenhower went on to impose crippling financial pressure_„îblocking a British loan petition at the International Monetary Fund and thereby jeopardizing London_„Žs solvency_„îuntil Her Majesty_„Žs government acceded to a ceasefire. The humiliating British and French withdrawal from Egypt took a battering ram to the global standing of America_„Žs two closest European allies and shattered any notion that they retained the capacity for autonomous action. All this transpired, moreover, in the halcyon days of postwar solidarity recalled so nostalgically today.  A decade and a half later, a new set of transatlantic divisions arose as the Vietnam War inspired large-scale protests across Europe. Despite the conflict_„Žs origins in French colonialism in Southeast Asia, now it was Washington that many Europeans saw as an imperialist bully. As a result, NATO allies declined to send forces to what the U.S. insisted was a vital front in the struggle against communism.  At the same time, political developments on the continent began to call into question fundamental assumptions of Western unity. Most alarming for the U.S. was the rise of Willy Brandt in West Germany and his pursuit of normalized relations with the communist bloc. Implicit in Brandt_„Žs so-called Ostpolitik was the danger of a neutral, unified German state emerging in the heart of Europe that could unravel the entire postwar security order. Washington, for its part, toppled one of the economic pillars of that order in 1971 by unilaterally suspending the convertibility of dollars into gold. The move took Europe by such surprise that it quickly became known as the _„ñNixon Shock_„; within two years, it brought an end to the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates."

But he and many other German leaders will be carefully, perhaps nervously, monitoring the talks between the two presidents.  Trump has made it something of a habit of late to single out Germany for criticism and any signs of agreement between him and Putin would further fray nerves in Berlin. Germany is particularly concerned about three issues.  The future of NATO  The cornerstone of German defense policy is its membership in NATO, so Berlin has been very disconcerted by Trump's occasional denigrating remarks about the trans-Atlantic alliance and his criticism of what he says is Germany's unfairly low military spending. Germans suspect that the timing of the Trump-Putin meeting, on the heels of a contentious NATO conference, is no accident.  ""It's an attempt to provoke Europe,"" Russia expert Stefan Meister of the German Council of Foreign Relations told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper ahead of the NATO summit. ""The big question is how reliable the American president will be and whether he will make promises to Putin that aren't agreed in advance with his NATO partners.""  Trump made few friends at the NATO summit in mid-week  Trump has sought to use at least the implicit threat of the United States scaling back its military presence in Europe to pressure NATO members to spend more on defense. That, according to Gwendolyn Sasse, the Academic Director of Berlin's Center for East European and International Studies, has contributed to ""a visual rupture in the relationship between the EU and the US."" Germans want Trump to act as a leading NATO member and not as a free agent when he sits down with Putin.  ""I hope that Trump's allies at the NATO summit showed him some lines he shouldn't cross in his relations with Russia,"" Rebecca Harms, a Green member of the European Parliament and a leading Putin critic, told Deutsche Welle.  Germans are under no doubts that Putin, for his part, is pursuing what Harms terms ""a long-term aggressive, anti-European policy"" and is trying to drive a wedge between the US and its European allies.  ""It is certain that the ongoing weakening of trans-Atlantic relations, including Trump's weakening of norms, values, principles and international institutions, is in the interests of the Russian leadership,"" Meister said. ""Moscow wants to negotiate its relationship with the West and play a new role in European security, and it has an interest in America withdrawing from Europe.""  That's something that Berlin does not want to see happen.  Watch video 00:28 Now live 00:28 mins. Trump: Crimea wouldn_„Žt have happened on my watch  The status of Crimea  A litmus test of how far Trump hews to the NATO line or cozies up to Putin will be Crimea. Germany has left no doubt of its condemnation of Russia's annexation of the peninsula, while Trump has sent mixed message, saying on Thursday that potentially recognizing the annexation was ""an interesting question.""  Should Trump make concessions to Putin on this score, Germany and the EU would interpret it as an act of betrayal.  ""If President Trump, as is to be feared on the basis of his statements, recognizes Crimea as Russian, he will be selling out not only the rights of Ukraine but also the security and sovereignty of states in Europe,"" Harms said.  ""The EU would never sign on to such a deal,"" said Sasse, ""but it would be a victory for Putin to reveal the unified front of the West as an illusion.""  The Nord Stream 2 pipeline has turned into a bone of contention  The prospects of the pipelines  Germans also have a very vested interest in Trump and Putin's discussions concerning the two Nord Stream natural gas pipelines from Russia to Germany via the Baltic Sea. Trump has been very critical of the project, claiming that it will leave Germany unacceptably dependent on the Kremlin. There has also been speculation that the US would like to sell Germany more natural gas itself.  But others think that Trump may be using the issue to demonstrate distance from Putin amidst allegations that Russian meddling helped him win the presidency in the 2016 US election.  ""For tactical reasons he's voicing some anti-Russian criticism because in the US people accuse him of being in cahoots with Putin,"" Daniela Schwarzer of the German Council of Foreign Relations told Reuters news agency.  But on this score, there are some within Germany who at least partially agree with Trump's criticism.  ""For the EU states, it's more important than ever to come up with a la carte Russia policies,"" said Harms. ""Individual projects like Nord Stream 2 run contrary to common security efforts since the pipeline is a strategic project intended to strengthen the influence of the Kremlin.""  In any case, it will be interesting to observe how Trump, having so castigated Germany, approaches the issue when he sits down on Monday."

Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said in a joint statement.  Sorry, Trump is right. The real embarrassment is that Germany, one of the wealthiest countries in Europe, spends just 1.24 percent of its gross domestic product on defense _„î in the bottom half of NATO allies. (The U.S. spends 3.5 percent of GDP on its military.) A study by McKinsey & Co. notes that about 60 percent of Germany_„Žs Eurofighter and Tornado fighter jets and about 80 percent of its Sea Lynx helicopters are unusable. According to Deutsche Welle, a German parliamentary investigation found that _„ñat the end of 2017, no submarines and none of the air force_„Žs 14 large transport planes were available for deployment due to repairs,_„ and _„ña Defense Ministry paper revealed German soldiers did not have enough protective vests, winter clothing or tents to adequately take part in a major NATO mission._„ Not enough tents?  To meet its promised NATO commitments, Germany needs to spend $28 billion more on defense annually. Apparently Germany can_„Žt come up with the money, but it can send billions of dollars to Russia _„î the country NATO was created to protect against _„î for natural gas and can support a new pipeline that will make Germany and Eastern European allies even more vulnerable to Moscow.  Sadly, Germany is not alone. Belgium, where NATO is headquartered, spends just 0.9 percent of GDP on defense _„î and fully one-third of its meager defense budget is spent on pensions. European NATO allies have about 1.8 million troops, but less than a third are deployable and just 6 percent for any sustained period.  When Trump says NATO is _„ñobsolete,_„ he is correct _„î literally.  This is not a new problem. I was at the Pentagon on Sept. 11, 2001, and vividly recall how, when it came time to take military action in Afghanistan, only a handful of allies had any useful war-fighting capabilities they could contribute during the critical early stages of Operation Enduring Freedom. At NATO_„Žs 2002 Prague summit, allies pledged to address these deficiencies by spending at least 2 percent of GDP on defense and investing that money in more usable capabilities. Instead, defense investments by European allies declined from 1.9 percent of GDP in 2000-2004 to 1.7 percent five years later, dropping further to 1.4 percent by 2015.  Little surprise that when NATO intervened in Libya a decade after 9/11, The Post reported, _„ñLess than a month into the Libyan conflict, NATO is running short of precision bombs, highlighting the limitations of Britain, France and other European countries in sustaining even a relatively small military action over an extended period of time._„ An alliance whose founding purpose is to deter Russian aggression could not sustain a limited bombing campaign against a far weaker adversary.  President Barack Obama called NATO allies _„ñfree riders,_„ and President George W. Bush urged allies to _„ñincrease their defense investments,_„ both to little effect. But when Trump refused to immediately affirm that the United States would meet its Article 5 commitment to defend a NATO ally, NATO allies agreed to boost spending by $12 billion last year. That is a drop in the bucket: McKinsey calculated that allies need to spend $107 billion more each year to meet their commitments. Since polite pressure by his predecessors did not work, Trump is digging in on a harder line: On Thursday he suggested NATO members double their defense spending targets to 4 percent of GDP.  This is not a gift to Russia, as his critics have alleged. The last thing Putin wants is for Trump to succeed in getting NATO to spend more on defense. And if allies are concerned about getting tough with Russia, there is an easy way to do so: invest in the capabilities NATO needs to deter and defend against Russian aggression.  Trump_„Žs hard line also does not signal that he considers NATO irrelevant. If Trump thought NATO was useless, he would not waste his time on it. But if allies don_„Žt invest in real, usable military capabilities, NATO will become irrelevant. An alliance that cannot effectively join the fight when one of its members comes under attack or runs out of munitions in the middle of a military intervention is, by definition, irrelevant.  NATO needs some tough love, and Trump is delivering it. Thanks to him, the alliance will be stronger as a result.

Its a blunt weapon.  The North Atlantic Treaty Organization set a goal for members to spend a set proportion of gross domestic product on defense at a 2014 meeting in Wales. Internally, not even NATO uses the figure as a standalone measure of what makes a good ally.  The 2 percent target Ðwas a politically acceptable compromiseÓ that NATO governments agreed to Ðso they wouldnt have to talk about the more difficult measures,Ó said Kathleen Hicks, director of the international security program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank. ÐI dont think its the real issue for Trump either -- even if all members met the target, I think hed still be pressuring them.Ó  As he left for Brussels, Trump again linked low NATO spending by allies to his bigger concern over the trade surpluses they run with the U.S. ÐNot fair to the U.S. taxpayer,Ó he tweeted.  One problem with the 2 percent target is math: Its as dependent on shifts in economic growth as it is on changes in defense spending. German officials, for example, say that in the 10 years to 2024, the country will have added 80 percent to its defense spending despite only inching a few basis points to reach 1.5 percent of GDP. Yet by 2024, Germany would be spending about as much on defense as Russia does today. By the same token, China has vastly increased its defense spending to $228 billion since 1990, but the share of GDP has barely moved.  Defense budget increases in inflation-adjusted dollars would make a more reliable measure of higher spending. On that score Trump could, if he wanted, claim credit for a significant boost last year. Romania was a standout, spending 38.6 percent more in 2017 than 2016. For Germany, Trumps main whipping post, that number was a healthy 6.6 percent. For two of the three tiny Baltic States it was over 20 percent.  Those increases probably had as much to do with fear of Russia and a recovering European economy as Trump. The trend began long before he took office:  ... Or Putin's Push? Europe's defense spending has rebounded sharply since Crimea's annexation   Source: International Institute for Strategic Studies  No one in Brussels is likely to begrudge the U.S. president a win if he wants to take it; anything to avoid another bust-up like last months G-7 summit in Canada. But judging by the letters and tweets Trump fired off ahead of this weeks meeting, he seems unlikely to take the high road.  Few European governments dispute that they need to do a lot better. Some came close to effective disarmament after the end of the Cold War. Germany may already spend about $40 billion a year on defense, but it gets little combat-ready capability for the money. Yet that isnt something the 2 percent target will necessarily identify or fix.   What if a country spends less but better, making it able to deliver troops, naval vessels and aircraft able to operate alongside U.S. forces? Or is more willing than others to actually deploy troops to fight? Or builds better infrastructure for NATO forces to cross its territory in the event of war? Or pays for training and force building in failing states? None of this would be captured by the current target.  NATO has a published secondary measure, for the proportion of national defense budgets spent on equipment. Greece, for example, exceeds the 2 percent spending goal, but fails on equipment. Almost three quarters of its budget goes to paying salaries and pensions that cant be deployed to any battlefield. That, however, just deals with one failure of the GDP target.  Hicks co-authored a report published this month that takes a stab at ranking countries by more measures of burden sharing. Below, for example, is a ranking compiled by Bloomberg from the CSIS reports data on troop contributions to eight NATO operations:  Present and Correct Average deployment over eight NATO operations, as % of total active duty troops   Source: CSIS Counting Dollars or Measuring Value, Bloomberg  Notes: Operations from 2002-2018, including: four periods in Afghanistan, NATO's force in Kosovo, UN peacekeeping contributions, its Enhanced Forward Presence in Eastern Europe and the Global Coalition Against ISIS.  This doesnt reflect the absolute scale, or the quality of contributions. Some countries, including Canada, France, the Netherlands and the U.K., sent their troops into combat in Afghanistan. Germany, burdened by its World War II history, restricted what its forces could do. Still, relative to the number of active duty troops that countries have, the chart indicates how willing they have been to show up when called.  And it isnt as though even German soldiers faced no risk; 54 lost their lives in Afghanistan since 2001. About 30 percent of coalition casualties -- in an operation called to aid the U.S. after the September 11, 2001 attacks -- have been suffered by non-American troops. The U.K., with 455 dead, suffered almost as high a casualty rate relative to its population size as did the U.S.:  Afghanistan Casualties Fatalities among Operation Enduring Freedom forces, 2001-2018   Source: iCasualties  Germany has argued that softer aspects of providing security such as development aid should be included in defense spending (that would get Berlin over the target at a stroke of a pen). The CSIS team didnt agree, but they came up with a definition of assistance that does contribute directly to security. Germany came out top:  Softer Power Aid that directly supports security turns out to be less than 0.1 percent of GDP   Source: CSIS: Counting Dollars or Measuring Value  But defined by the CSIS report, these ÐsoftÓ expenditures on security assistance are negligible. Now take a look at them (in blue) next to the Ðhard powerÓ budgets (in red):  Hard vs Soft NATO spending of defense dwarfs security assistance, as percentage of GDP   Source: CSIS Counting Dollars or Measuring Value  Other measures the CSIS team chose would be controversial if proposed at NATO, especially where the current White House is concerned. One looks at the trade sacrifices countries made to enforce sanctions against Iran (where Trump might agree this should count as a contribution to security), and Russia (where he might not). Heres what happened to trade with Russia as a result of sanctions imposed after its 2014 military interventions in Ukraine:  Willing to Sacrifice Top 10 NATO countries, by trade lost to Russia sanctions, in $ billions   Source: CSIS Counting Dollars or Measuring Value  Note: Measure change in trade 2012-2016. Sanctions were imposed in 2014.  Almost certainly, Trump would take issue with another CSIS criterion: The willingness of NATO members to accept refugees from conflict zones. Its a complex argument, but suffice to say that Turkeys willingness to host more than 3 million refugees from Syria has made a contribution to the security of European NATO members further West (and one the European Union pays Turkey to continue):  Refugee Shock Absorbers Average number of refugees hosted 2013-2016, per 100,000 of total population.   Source: CSIS Counting Dollars or Measuring Value  So who are the best alliance members? Its a hard question to answer, but its pretty clear that Greece isnt number two to the U.S. -- as it would be in terms of defense spending as a percentage of GDP. CSIS is pushing NATO to publish its classified benchmarks to make the issue more transparent and balanced.  In the meantime, here is an unweighted ranking of where allies stand on the combined published NATO and CSIS benchmarks, compiled by Bloomberg. It is wholly unscientific, though perhaps no less flawed than the 2 percent target that is monopolizing NATO debate:"

1286,7/14/18,Jeremy Diamond,https://www.cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/14/politics/trump-uk-nato-takeaways/index.html,"Glasgow, Scotland (CNN) As President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Theresa May arrived at the lip of the stairs leading to their lecterns, the US President took his British counterpart's hand and helped her down the four short steps to the stage.  Just a day earlier, it seemed as if Trump would sooner shove May off a much steeper metaphorical ledge.  Trump provided the proverbial push in an interview Thursday that dominated British news, criticizing May's handling of Brexit negotiations and warning that her current plan would ""kill"" the possibility of a US-UK free trade deal -- the very issue that had May's government teetering on the brink of collapse.  But at the news conference less than 24 hours removed from that interview, Trump took pains to repeatedly shower May with praise and characterized the US-UK relationship as ""the highest level of special."" On Brexit, he said, ""Whatever you do is OK with me.""  The about-face and contradictory statements were just the latest instance of Trump plunging the world into a reality-bending twilight zone shaped by his own actions and statements over the course of his European trip this week. They leave an open question as to which reality Trump will subscribe to as he holds his Monday summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin . His performance so far also will leave Putin -- and the American public -- wondering what they can believe.  Just days earlier in Brussels, Trump offered startlingly cutting criticism of one of the closest US allies -- accusing Germany of being ""a captive of Russia"" -- before insisting hours later that he has ""a very, very good relationship with (German Chancellor Angela Merkel)"" and a ""tremendous relationship with Germany.""  The truth revealed itself in the stiff body language between the two leaders, who did not shake hands for the cameras and appeared miles apart even as they sat just feet from each other.  But the President's tour-de-grace came during his suddenly announced solo news conference at the end of the NATO summit that sent reporters scrambling to make it into the room on time and wondering whether Trump would announce the US was leaving NATO after reports suggested he had threatened to do so earlier in the day.  Instead, Trump took to his lectern in the darkly lit room to proclaim that all NATO allies had ""agreed to substantially up their commitment"" to defense spending ""at levels that they've never thought of before."" Despite his insulting and critical comments of close US allies during the summit and his private threats, Trump insisted the alliance was ""very unified, very strong.""  ""No problem, right?"" Trump said.  But none of those claims passed muster. As the French President Emmanuel Macron, who maintains one of the most genial personal relationships with Trump of any world leader, made clear soon after Trump's news conference, NATO allies did nothing more than recommit themselves to the previously agreed 2% of GDP defense spending by 2024.  ""The communique is clear,"" Macron said. ""It reaffirms a commitment to 2% in 2024. That is all.""  Dueling narratives  As for the unity of the alliance, the words and images Trump put out to the world signaled anything but the united front lawmakers in Washington and US allies abroad had hoped the US and NATO would project ahead of Trump's summit with Putin in Helsinki on Monday.  After his blistering criticism of Germany, he and Merkel -- heads of the largest economies in the alliance -- could not have found themselves further apart as NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg led the group of world leaders through the cavernous lobby of the alliance headquarters. Merkel found herself in the front, while Trump straggled behind.  Then there was Trump's late arrival for NATO's second day that only amplified the sense of unease that still lingered in the building after his first day. Just as he had during his similarly tense attendance at the G7 summit in Quebec last month, Trump arrived about 30 minutes late for a working session with his counterparts, confidently striding through the entrance hall were cameras could capture his arrival.  But which version of reality will Trump project as he meets with Putin in Helsinki?  Will it be the one of Trump fracturing the alliance that is the strongest bulwark against Russian aggression and undermining his closest counterparts? Or will it be the other version, in which the NATO alliance has been strengthened and the partnership between the US and its close allies across the Atlantic stand united before Putin?  The US and NATO allies did pledge in Brussels to bolster their defense and deterrence capabilities as a bulwark against Putin -- a notable achievement. NATO allies have also increased defense spending by $33 billion in the last year, which led Trump to ask Friday: ""Do you think Putin's happy about that?""  But it's Trump's version of reality on another topic that may come to define his meeting with Putin.  'Eyes wide open'  US Ambassador to Russia Jon Huntsman has already asserted that Trump will need to ""go in with eyes wide open"" when he meets with Putin and make ""a sober assessment of the root causes of our problems.""  ""So what are the underlying causes of past crises?"" Huntsman told reporters last week. ""Dialogue on the true state of the relationship is what is needed.""  Trump's assessment of the impediments to improving US-Russia relations may not jive with the US government's.  ""We do have a political problem where you know in the United States we have this stupidity going on. Pure stupidity,"" Trump said in an apparent reference to the special counsel's investigation stemming from Russian meddling in the 2016 election and the surrounding partisanship. ""It makes it very hard to do something with Russia. Anything you do, it's always going to be, 'Oh, Russia, he loves Russia.' ""  Trump and Putin have displayed a chummy chemistry in their first meetings and Putin's approach to Trump could be key to the summit's outcome.  The US President has repeatedly shown that flattery, praise and a welcoming atmosphere are the fastest ways to his heart. His comments about May came as he prepared to head to London, where planned protests and criticism from London's mayor awaited his arrival.  But after May rolled out the red carpet and many of the trappings of an official state visit -- even though it was not one -- and offered glowing remarks about Trump and the US-UK relationship during a gala dinner in his honor, the President appeared to change his tune. A source with knowledge of the discussions told CNN's Michelle Kosinski that Trump's ""eyes lit up"" during May's speech and said the two ""never bonded better.""  The next morning, after his comments broke, Trump did the unthinkable and offered May an apology.  But Merkel -- who is known for her awfully revealing poker face -- is still waiting."

As if Trump hadn't started the day with a hate-filled tirade against Germany. As if he hadn't just lambasted the country as being a ""captive of Russia"" or said that ""Germany is totally controlled by Russia."" As if he hadn't spent days volleying salvoes at Germany on Twitter because the country still isn't doing what Trump, as the American president, wants it to be doing. As if he hasn't described the whole situation as being ""not acceptable.""  There was nary a mention of these things in the meeting. It turns out that the faÍ_ade can still hold even in the midst of serious conflicts. They smiled, they shook hands, they greeted each other by first name. They have a ""very, very good relationship,"" Trump said. By the time the two had sat down in their white armchairs, it was no longer about NATO or about the 2-percent defense spending target the White House has been insisting on by the alliance's ""delinquent"" members. Nope, now, it was about Ivanka.  Trump wanted to send greetings from his daughter to the German chancellor. Ivanka is very impressed with you, he said, likely intending it as a compliment.  For the moment, all that was left of the trans-Atlantic relationship were greetings from Ivanka.  A Showdown Against Germany  Trump turned this week's NATO summit into a showdown with Germany and its chancellor -- Trump against Merkel, Trump against Germany. At the peak of the crisis, Trump even threatened to withdraw the U.S. from the alliance. For two entire days, he allowed doubts to persist about NATO's very survival.  Since his election as the 45th U.S. president, Trump has shown that he has no use for either allies or partners. He's waging a trade war against China; he caused the collapse of the G7 summit in June; and he disparaged Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as ""very dishonest"" and ""weak.""

Germany of all countries, for decades one of America's closest allies. The country that stood on the front lines of the Cold War, it seems, has now become Trump's Enemy No. 1.  Trump rages about the German cars being driven on American roads, he harbors illusions about some horrendous uptick in crime in Germany and is pleased about how allegedly dissatisfied the German people are with their government. The Germans, Trump recently blustered, are ""turning against their leadership.""  The U.S. president seems to view Germany with a mixture of jealousy, admiration and anger. Trump is convinced that Germany's economic success is in large part attributable to what he perceives as the Germans' highly adept ability in the past at exploiting the Americans. Trump's line seems to be that his predecessors may have let the cunning German chancellor get away with pulling one over on them in the past, but those days are over now.  Trump mixes everything together -- trade with defense; the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline with Iran. But it's German defense spending that is the focus of the current attacks. In Trump's mind, the Germans are freeloaders whose security is guaranteed by the Americans, who get very little back in return.  'We Are Not Prisoners'  Discontent has been stewing in Berlin for weeks over the U.S. president's shortcomings. Trump's tone along with the constant rebukes and insults are infuriating even the staunchest supporters of trans-Atlantic relations.  ""We are not prisoners -- neither of Russia nor of the U.S.,"" says German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas. ""We make decisions about our budget, our energy supply and our trade relations freely, sovereignly and on the basis of facts.""  So why does Trump have it out for Germany, of all countries? Perhaps it's the mixture of economic strength, military restraint and moral hubris in Germany that makes Berlin the subject of Trump's loathing.  DER SPIEGEL The article you are reading is part of the cover package in this week's issue of DER SPIEGEL.  What is certain is that there is no other country he is attacking as persistently. Even back in spring 2017, the European Council on Foreign Relations think tank concluded: ""Germany, not China, will be Trump's enemy No. 1.""  ""Germany may be a target for Trump because he sees it as a rich nation that profited from the Marshall Plan after World War II, that rose to economic power and now isn't paying its dues,"" says Jim Townsend of the Center for a New American Security.  British historian Timothy Garton Ash suggests we should be asking Sigmund Freud for answers to Trump. In an interview in this week's issue of DER SPIEGEL, he argues that rational explanations will do little to help on that front. The psychological explanations run the gamut from Trump's German roots to his aversion to strong women like Angela Merkel.  Looking at it from Trump's possible point of view, a number of factors come together that could inspire his apparent contempt for Merkel: her close relationship with Barack Obama, the predecessor Trump hates or, perhaps, her notoriously unshakeable calm, which has already raised the ire of numerous irascible men both at home and abroad.  'Attacking Her Is Almost a Natural Reaction'  The fact that the liberal American press that Trump so despises has championed Merkel as its heroine may also be contributing to his aversion to her. ""Merkel defends certain liberal values like multiculturalism and open borders in Europe, making her in some ways the political antidote to Trump,"" says Stephen Walt, professor of international relations at Harvard. ""Attacking her is almost a natural reaction.""  Nicholas Burns, the former U.S. ambassador to NATO, won't even rule out the possibility that Trump may be seeking to topple the German leader. ""I can come to no other conclusion but that he is trying to weaken her,"" says Burns. He says Trump judges Germany solely on the size of its trade surplus with the U.S. ""He is so focused on that, so consumed by it, that he can't see all the benefits that we get from our alliance with Germany,"" Burns says. He describes Trump's attacks on Merkel as ""embarrassing to our country.""  To be sure, Merkel and Trump have already clashed several times in the past. But the conflict has never been as tense as it was this week.  The showdown between the chancellor and the president took place behind closed doors on the second day of the NATO summit in Brussels. The actual agenda for the summit itself didn't provide any real causes for dispute. It covered routine matters like the relationship with Georgia and the Western alliance's ties with Ukraine -- all points upon which the Germans and Americans should be able to readily agree.  But Trump doesn't want to play along. He seeks conflict rather than peace. First, he arrived late for the meeting, and then he unleashed his standard litany of complaints. How the Germans cheat the Americans in trade, the many BMWs driving on American roads, the gas from Russia and Berlin's refusal to spend more money on its armed forces, the Bundeswehr.  Trump Threatens to 'Go His Own Way'  It was the standard animosity which has become the norm and which Merkel has been forced to get used to. This time around, though, Trump didn't turn to Twitter as his weapon of choice. Instead, he attacked the Germans in front of all the allies at a meeting of NATO's most important body, the North Atlantic Council. It was an unprecedented move.  DER SPIEGEL Military Expenditures  Trump talked himself into a fury and then began issuing threats. He said every NATO country, including Germany, should reach the 2-percent target by next year. That, though, contradicts everything that the allies agreed to at the 2014 summit in Wales. Back then, the partners agreed to ""aim"" to spend 2 percent of gross domestic product on defense by 2024. Now it's supposed to happen by next year? Otherwise, Trump raged, he would ""go his own way.""  An American president placing a question mark over NATO's future? It's outrageous. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg then interrupted the meeting -- the representatives of Georgia and Ukraine had to leave the chamber because their countries are not part of NATO. It was clear to everyone at that point that it would not be possible to go back to the set agenda after Trump's tirade.  Don't Mention the 'W' Word  America's allies were appalled, and even Trump's own advisers appeared uneasy. Putting pressure on the Germans is one thing, but blowing up NATO altogether? No, that's not what Trump's people want. They advised their colleagues from the other member states not to discuss the summit declaration, which reaffirms the 2-percent pledge made in Wales.  Merkel had planned to appear before the press at around 10 a.m., but now she had to postpone the appointment. Instead, NATO leaders held a crisis meeting. All staff were asked to leave the room, with only the leaders and one other member of each government allowed to remain in the room. For Merkel, that person was Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen. But as with his ice cream portions, Trump got extra scoops. Joining him were Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, National Security Advisor John Bolton and White House Spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders.  Merkel and Trump sat far apart at the oval table, with the seating order determined by the alphabet -- from ""A"" for Albania to ""U"" for United States. Stoltenberg began. We have to talk about burden-sharing, he said. The aim, he said, was to leave the summit with a clear commitment to NATO.  Then Trump began to speak. The others already had a clue of what would come now. More venom against Germany. ""So, we're supposed to protect Germany, but they're getting their energy from Russia,"" he said. ""Explain that. And it can't be explained."" It's ""unfair,"" he said.  The first to respond was Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskait. She's a trained karate fighter, and in this fight, she positioned herself to protect the Germans. Grybauskait proposed agreeing on certain steps to increase spending. Like the others in the room, she also didn't want to utter the ""W"" word. ""W"" for Wales.  The reason is clear: The Wales agreement had been signed by Barack Obama and is thus a toxic document for Trump. When the president hears the word ""Wales,"" it apparently makes him think of Obama and causes him to throw a tantrum. French President Emmanuel Macron also dodged the ""W"" word, instead referring to the efforts European members are making within the NATO alliance. He also noted that the U.S. defense industry benefits from the fact that Europeans are already now spending so much more money on defense.  'We Know We Have To Do More'  Then it was Merkel's turn. The Germans, she said, are already spending much more on defense than in the past. She can rattle off the list almost by memory these days. It includes the proposed new NATO logistics command center in Ulm, the Bundeswehr deployment in Afghanistan, the 17 years spent at the side of the United States there, the fact that Berlin is NATO's second-largest supplier of troops as well as the already approved decision to increase the military's budget to 1.5 percent of GDP by 2024. ""Our hands are completely full just implementing that,"" she said.  But an increase in defense spending to reach 2 percent by next year? Totally impossible. ""We know we have to do more,"" she would later tell the press. But she didn't add more. ""We're going to have to talk about the extent to which we will increase spending on equipment,"" she said, ""and by that I clearly mean equipment and not arms."" She kept things vague and didn't make any promises.  After Merkel, the British spoke, followed by the Dutch. But Trump couldn't hold back. He attacked the Germans again. Only 1.2 percent for defense, he asked? That's impossible. He then addressed Merkel directly: ""Angela."" Once again, he complained about Germany's gas deals with Russia.  The chancellor countered that Germany gets less than 40 percent of its natural gas supplies from Russia. But Trump wouldn't let it go. In the U.S. it looks as though the country is getting ripped off here, he scolded.  By then, it was almost noon, and it was time for the smaller NATO countries to have their say. They sided with Merkel. During a break, Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama went up to the German chancellor. His country had been the only one singled out for praise by Trump, but he didn't want to create the impression that Albania had somehow become Trump's model pupil.  Finally, Stoltenberg moved to end the meeting. The secretary general had been determined to rescue the summit. He suggested that NATO leaders leave the meeting with the message that, despite the differences, they had committed themselves to NATO and to higher defense spending. Next year, on the occasion of NATO's 70th birthday, it will be possible to measure the progress that has been made. It's a meaningless formulation -- everyone is aware of that -- but perhaps it somehow helps them.  After the meeting, Trump stated publicly that Germany had committed itself to a further increase in defense spending. But that's fake news, sources close to Merkel said. The chancellor's position, they noted, is precisely the one she shared with the press -- namely that the idea that the Germans are somehow unfairly exploiting the Americans is a fixation Trump has harbored for decades. In his now infamous 1990 interview with Playboy, Trump complained of how so-called ""allies,"" a word he placed in quotation marks for emphasis, are ""screwing us."" Although he also spoke of other countries, those remarks were primarily directed at West Germany.  When asked what he would do first if he were president, Trump replied: ""I'd throw a tax on every Mercedes-Benz rolling into this country and we'd have wonderful allies again.""  'German Blood ... Great Stuff'  There has been repeated speculation over whether Trump's own heritage may influence his fury toward Germany. The fact that his ancestors emigrated from the town of Kallstadt in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate certainly doesn't seem to have fostered any kind of affinity in Trump for his ancestral home.  At best, Trump has an ambivalent relationship with his German roots. The family didn't show much pride about its origins. On the contrary: During the Nazi period, Trump's father Fred began claiming the family had emigrated from Sweden to the U.S.  Fred Trump had justifiable reasons for concealing his true origins. During the mid-20th century in the U.S., identifying yourself as German wasn't exactly something that would provide a boost to business, and this was particularly true in a city like New York, with its large Jewish population.  That's apparently why Trump repeated the claim in his book ""The Art of the Deal,"" published in 1987, that the family came from Sweden. The New York Times has reported that Trump asked his father prior to publication why they still ""had to do this Swedish thing?"" It is unknown how his father answered.  By the 1990s, that concern seemed to have significantly diminished. When asked by Vanity Fair magazine in a 1990 interview whether he was not in fact of German origin, he answered: ""Actually, it was very difficult. My father was not German; my father's parents were German ... Swedish, and really sort of all over Europe.""  In 1999, Trump led New York's Steuben Parade, an event held by the German-American community, as its grand marshal. In a video message to the event, he said: ""We passed Trump Tower, 69 stories. I looked up and I said, 'This is a long way from Kallstadt.' I'm a proud German-American.""  In the 2015 documentary ""Kings of Kallstadt,"" Trump reaffirmed his family roots. ""I have great German heritage, I am very proud of it, great place."" He also added, ""I'm proud to have that German blood. There's no question about it -- great stuff."" He then ticked down the list of his typical German characteristics. ""I'm strong and I'm very reliable. I'm on time, I get things done -- and that's basically the whole German culture.""  Nevertheless, it doesn't appear that Trump's commitment to his German roots has done much to ease his relationship with Germany. Nor does his view of the world seem to have changed much since the Playboy interview. He has repeated many of the passages featured in it in some way or other since his election. Like when he said Americans are laughed at for defending wealthy nations and getting nothing in return. ""Our allies make billions by ripping us off.""  Over the years, Trump has remained fixated on Germany as the alleged primary beneficiary of American largesse. ""Probably the greatest leader in the world,"" Trump said in praise of Merkel in 2015. But when Time magazine named the chancellor its ""Person of the Year"" four months later, Trump sent out a furious tweet. ""I told you @TIME Magazine would never pick me as person of the year despite being the big favorite They picked person who is ruining Germany.""  A Fateful Vote for Merkel?  The odd thing is that it's possible Merkel would not still be chancellor today were it not for Trump. His election in November 2016 came during a time in which Merkel was mulling whether to run for another term or not. People close to Merkel say she was seriously wrestling with the question at the time and that if Hillary Clinton had won the election, the chancellor probably would have stepped down.  As we know today, things turned out differently. When Trump was elected president on Nov. 8, 2016, the chancellor sent her congratulations, but her choice of wording marked a first in German-American postwar history. Her statement contained the usual polite formulations, but ended by admonishing that the U.S. and Germany are united by values such as democracy and respect for human dignity. ""I offer the next president of the United States close cooperation on the basis of those values,"" Merkel said.  It was an affront to say the very least. A German chancellor reminding the American president that he must respect his own, 200-year-old Constitution? When the chancellor visited Trump in Washington for the first time in March 2017, the frosty climate was attributed to Merkel's rather unorthodox congratulatory message.  The chancellor herself viewed the situation differently. In the final days of his presidency, she held a long conversation with Barack Obama during a lengthy dinner at Berlin's Hotel Adlon as part of his last official visit to Berlin in mid-November 2016. From Merkel's perspective, Trump is driven largely by his rejection of the Obama era. As a person considered to be a very close ally of Obama, she is thus a target of the same hostilities.  An Ahistorical President  Initially, many in the German government thought Trump, like so many presidents before him, would eventually be tamed once he was in the White House. But Merkel herself never counted as one of the proponents of that theory. She said early on that Trump would implement his agenda point by point, and she was right.  In Merkel's eyes, Trump is an ahistorical president, meaning that nothing that happened before his term in office holds any relevance to him. That in part explains why he is just as rude in his dealings with the United Nations and NATO as he is with the G7 states. This is further complicated by Trump's tendency to lump problems together.  And it's not as if Merkel hasn't made any effort. During her last visit to Washington at the end of April, she gave Trump an etching dating back to 1705 that includes an image of Palatinate and Kallstadt. Merkel also invited the president to visit the small town.  The chancellor can even see what she views as a very friendly side of Trump. At the same time, she doesn't believe that flattery will work in steering him away from his plans. Merkel followed with a certain amount satisfaction how Emmanuel Macron initially made a major effort to court Trump, one that produced little by way of results."

The nonbinding motion, which came as the Senate voted to reconcile its version of the annual defense policy bill with that of the House, expresses the Senate's support for NATO and calls on negotiators to reaffirm the U.S. commitment to it.  The 97-2 vote in the Senate comes as Trump heads to Brussels. He will also travel to the United Kingdom and meet one-on-one with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki during his trip.  GOP Sens. Rand Paul (Ky.) and Mike Lee (Utah) voted against the measure.  Democratic Sen. Jack Reed (R.I.) proposed the measure, calling the U.S. support for NATO ""ironclad.""  Trump has long been critical of NATO members for failing to meet their defense spending commitments, and has ramped up the criticism in the days ahead of the summit.  The president suggested in a tweet on his way to Brussels that other NATO members should reimburse the U.S. for what he has called the nation's ""unfair"" contributions to the alliance.  NATO members agreed in 2014 to increase their defense spending to 2 percent of their gross domestic product by 2024. But Trump has incorrectly suggested that this spending is meant to be on NATO as a whole, not on the countries' individual defense.  The attacks also come as Trump has frustrated key allies like the European Union, Canada and Mexico with steep tariffs on steel and aluminum imports."

It_„Žs a bunch of godless socialists, just like those heretics in Berkeley and Cambridge. Euro-bashing became a unifying conservative trope.  Progressives fell into the poisonous trap of racialism. They looked at the glories of Aristotle, Shakespeare and Mozart, and the most interesting thing they had to say about them was that they were dead white males. Future historians will marvel at how sophisticated people willfully made themselves so simple-minded. Eurocentrism became a code word for colonialism, oppression and privilege, taking a piece of European history for the whole of it.  Europeans didn_„Žt help. In the wake of the Cold War, they have dedicated themselves to a post-nationalist project that is too top-down and technocratic and is now crumbling.  The Euro-American political project is now nearing end times. George W. Bush feuded with Europe over the Iraq war. Barack Obama pivoted away. Now, as Robert Kagan writes in The Washington Post, Trump is taking a sledgehammer to the Atlantic alliance.  Trump could have gone to last week_„Žs NATO summit and taken credit only for increased European military spending. Instead, he moved the goal posts, humiliated the Europeans, reasserted his trade war talk and made it impossible for European leaders to do anything that might seem to support him. These are the actions of a man who wants the alliance to fail.  His embrace of Putin Monday was a victory dance on the Euro-American tomb.  _„ñThis is not just another family quarrel,_„ Kagan writes. _„ñThe democratic alliance that has been the bedrock of the American-led liberal world order is unraveling. At some point, and probably sooner than we expect, the global peace that that alliance and that order undergirded will unravel, too. Despite our human desire to hope for the best, things will not be okay._„  Kagan was writing before Monday_„Žs press conference, and now his core point is doubly true.

He then claimed, falsely, to have won major concessions, and graciously declared that it is _„ñpresently unnecessary_„ to consider quitting the alliance.  Was there anything our allies could have done that would have mollified him? The answer, surely, is no. For Trump, disrupting NATO doesn_„Žt seem to be a means to an end; it_„Žs an end in itself.  Does all of this sound familiar? It_„Žs basically the same as the story of the escalating trade war. While Trump rants about other countries_„Ž unfair trade practices _„î a complaint that has some validity for China, although virtually none for Canada or the European Union _„î he hasn_„Žt made any coherent demands. That is, he has given no indication what any of the countries hit by his tariffs could do to satisfy him, leaving them with no option except retaliation.

He then raised the ante, demanding that they meet the 2 percent target _„î it_„Žs a target, not some specific legal obligation _„î by January and then go on to raise spending to 4 percent of G.D.P. Why that much? What strategic objective, what threats to the alliance, is Mr. Trump worried about? He didn't say.  Since he came into office, Mr. Trump_„Žs urging has gotten some allies to accelerate spending increases. The response to his latest remonstrations, though, was mainly bafflement. Even after a military spending increase under President Trump, American military spending is only 3.2 percent of G.D.P. this year. What_„Žs more, it_„Žs expected to fall to 2.8 percent in 2024, leaving it unclear as to how even the United States would meet the 4 percent figure.  As Mr. Trump, and Mr. Obama before him, have argued, Europe can do more to help itself. The allies rely too heavily on the Americans to transport troops and equipment, for instance, and the fact that France ran out of bombs during the 2011 Libya operation demonstrated a crucial weakness . There may be other shortcomings, too _„î NATO is not transparent with its data.  Greater spending by American allies might mean the United States could lower its own spending and bring thousands of troops home. Mr. Trump didn_„Žt make that argument, but he has often talked about withdrawing forces and closing bases, whether in Germany or Syria or somewhere else.  So would the president then push for cuts in the Pentagon budget, which now stands at roughly $700 billion, more than the next eight countries in the world spend together, and use it for, say, badly needed infrastructure? Don_„Žt bet on it. Mr. Trump has relentlessly pushed for a bigger military, seemingly mesmerized by the flashy hardware and the show of hard power that it projects."

But McCain told lawmakers that acceding to Paul's objection to Balkan nation Montenegro joining the international military alliance would be to serve Moscow's interests. NATO has undergone a massive military escalation in the past year to counter what its members describe as Russian aggression after the 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine.  ""You are achieving the objectives of Vladimir Putin...trying to dismember this small country which has already been the subject of an attempted coup,_„ McCain said, without initially mentioning Paul by name, according to CBS News.

He referred to U.S. active combat operations in four Middle Eastern countries and the heavy costs of maintaining U.S. contributions to NATO.  _„ñCurrently, the United States has troops in dozens of countries and is actively fighting in Iraq, Syria, Libya and Yemen (with the occasional drone strike in Pakistan),_„ the statement read, according to The Hill. _„ñIn addition, the United States is pledged to defend 28 countries in NATO.

Trump upended the summit even before it started by unleashing a tirade against Germany during a breakfast meeting on Wednesday with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and created further upheaval by hijacking a meeting Thursday morning about Ukraine and Georgia during which he again demanded that allies quickly increase their national military spending and threatened that if they failed to do so, the U.S. could break with the alliance and start conducting security policy unilaterally, by going its _„ñown way._„  Reaction to Trump_„Žs tirades against European allies _„î not just on military spending but also on trade and other issues _„î has focused mainly on the major powers of Germany, France and the United Kingdom.  But Trump_„Žs behavior has been just as unnerving, if not more so, to smaller allies that have long counted on Washington and shown unwavering loyalty to the Western alliance.  In the NATO leaders_„Ž meeting that focused on spending _„î what the alliance refers to as _„ñburden sharing_„ _„î Danish Prime Minister Lars LÍ™kke Rasmussen said he confronted Trump, noting that the Danish military had suffered casualties participating in the U.S.-led mission in Afghanistan roughly in the same proportion as the U.S. military.  In an emotional presentation, Rasmussen told the president that he had attended the funerals and could not accept Trump telling him that Denmark was not doing enough for NATO. _„ñIn direct and clear speech, I have made it clear to him that Denmark_„Žs contribution cannot be measured in money,_„ Rasmussen said.  _„ñThe U.S. president has come up with some pretty bombastic announcements and Twitter has moved into the conference room,_„ he said during a post-summit briefing.  Denmark_„Žs foreign minister, Anders Samuelsen, chimed in with his own concern: _„ñIt is a new reality, and you have to look past both spelling and factual mistakes and take Trump serious when he barrels forward with his Twitter._„  When a Croatian journalist confronted Trump about his inconsistencies, the president flatly denied there were any, and he repeated a defense of his own sanity that he had made when previously questioned about his fitness for the presidency.  _„ñWe understand your message, but some people ask themselves, will you be tweeting differently once you board the Air Force One?_„ the reporter said.  Trump, speaking at his news conference before leaving the summit, replied: _„ñNo, that's other people that do that. I don_„Žt. I_„Žm very consistent. I_„Žm a very stable genius._„  But leaders who spent the first 18 months of Trump_„Žs presidency thinking there might be a method to his chaos creation _„î and struggling to discern what it might be _„î now seem to have concluded that it_„Žs just chaos, and that Trump himself may not understand what he_„Žs doing.  While Washington has long ago grown numb to Trump_„Žs unrelenting mayhem, the president_„Žs two days of undulations in Brussels, rolling between enraged criticism and boastful, happy proclamations, left many leaders feeling queasy.  It_„Žs not just Trump_„Žs casual disregard for longstanding protocol, like the way he showed up late to the summit on Thursday, before forcing the discussion back to the issue of spending, which had not been on the day_„Žs agenda.  Trump also committed a cardinal sin of diplomacy by conflating issues that are typically kept in silos _„î like military spending and trade, or energy policy, in the case of the German gas pipeline project _„î to reduce the chance of rupturing negotiations.  Trump derided Germany at the breakfast Wednesday as _„ñtotally controlled by Russia_„ because of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, accusing Berlin of paying billions to Russia while essentially shirking its duties to NATO.  _„ñYou know, we_„Žre protecting Germany, we_„Žre protecting France. We_„Žre protecting everybody. And yet we_„Žre paying a lot of money to protect,_„ Trump said, adding, _„ñI have to bring it up, because I think it_„Žs very unfair to our country._„  Then, at an appearance with German Chancellor Angela Merkel at the summit that same afternoon, he said, _„ñWe have a very, very good relationship with the chancellor. We have a tremendous relationship with Germany._„  A senior NATO official said leaders had concluded that they simply could not rely on anything Trump said.  _„ñYou know the way he speaks, you cannot take him literally,_„ the official said.  Another EU official echoed the point. _„ñHe speaks a language that doesn_„Žt match with diplomacy,_„ the second official said. _„ñWe were used to the Brits, who speak a more frank diplomatic language, but this is another thing._„  Macron, at his own post-summit news conference, tried to spin the situation positively, saying he believed NATO had emerged stronger because in the end Trump had declared _„ñstrong commitment_„ to the alliance.  In a slight dig, Macron said he was not interested in declarations away from the leaders_„Ž table. _„ñOne makes announcements on these subjects, I prefer a serious spirit,_„ Macron said. At another point, Macron complained: _„ñSometimes tweets are more important than what is negotiated._„  But for evidence that he is, in fact, a _„ñgenius,_„ Trump might point to the closing assessment of NATO_„Žs secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, who suggested that Trump_„Žs hectoring was having a positive impact on the alliance.  _„ñAll allies have heard President Trump_„Žs message loud and clear. We understand that this American president is very serious about defense spending,_„ he said. _„ñThere is a new sense of urgency due to President Trump_„Žs strong leadership on defense spending._„  In fact, this week_„Žs summit yielded no new spending pledges from NATO nations _„î despite Trump_„Žs boasts otherwise.  And Trump once again made European allies feel as though he sees them as adversaries rather than friends. He again said his Monday meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin may be the easiest part of his trip. And he jabbed at the U.K. over the Brexit chaos that has led to the recent resignations of Cabinet ministers just before he headed there for state visit.  _„ñI said I_„Žm going to a few hot spots,_„ Trump said during his news conference. _„ñWe have NATO, then we have the U.K., and then we have Putin. And I said, Putin may be the easiest of them all. You never know. But I_„Žm going to a pretty hot spot right now, right, with a lot of resignations._„  Kait Bolongaro and Philip Kaleta contributed to this report."

Nearly two years later, it has become fairly clear why those experts, along with so many others including Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, were so concerned.  Not only has Trump alienated US allies on trade by erecting unilateral tariffs that have kickstarted a trade war, he is now ratcheting up tensions further by threatening another pillar of Western democracy _„î the post-war security alliance encompassed in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, or NATO  In a repeat performance of his G7 attrition with other top world leaders _„î and key US allies _„î Trump is bashing NATO countries in advance of meeting Russian autocrat Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, Finland.  Trump again stunned US allies by sounding deeply critical of the longstanding post-war security alliance of 29 nations. The US president repeated misrepresentations about how NATO is funded, suggesting that nations contribute to some common security fund that in reality does not exist. He also wrongly stated he had achieved an increase in defense spending by US allies, when no such agreement was reached.  In the same breath, he sounded a strongly conciliatory tone with the Russian leader despite the US intelligence community's assessment that Putin not only meddled in the 2016 elections to help Trump but also continues his cyberwar efforts going into the 2018 mid-terms.  This gives Putin, who invaded the Ukrainian territory of Crimea in early 2014 without major reaction from the West, even more leeway to shape the global balance of power despite its relative economic weakness versus major adversaries like China and the United States.  In a forceful rebuke, former US Secretary of State John Kerry expressed in a statement much of the sentiment shared by US allies:  ""President Trump makes public adversaries out of our friends, and turns our adversary, who has been attacking America's democracy, into his fawned-over ally. Why? Why would an American president whose first NATO meeting last year was a disaster, show up in Belgium this year just to prove he doesn't understand how vital alliances have made a huge difference for the security of the United States and the lives of Europeans?""  NATO was literally America's way of creating a post-war security umbrella for its own interests. It's ironic that it's the American president himself who seems intent on undermining the alliance, whose vow of mutual cooperation was last triggered after the 9/11 terrorist attacks on New York and Washington.  ""NATO was part of a Holy Trinity of institutions, together with the predecessors to the EU and WTO, initiated by the United States between 1947 and 1949 to organize the non-communist world politically and economically,"" Benn Steil, senior fellow and director of international economics at the Council on Foreign Relations, told Business Insider.  ""Trump has no alternative vision for organizing the world _„î he is wholly in destruction mode,"" said Steil, author of a new book on the Marshall Plan."

(Tatyana Zenkovich/Pool via Reuters)  The continent_„Žs failures of governance have never been more obvious.  It was a hot and difficult summer. And Europeans were pained to hear the blunt assessment that the U.S. would not be able to forever sustain NATO without greater investment on their part. The alliance was heading for _„ñcollective military irrelevance_„ and the current state of affairs was _„ñunacceptable,_„ the American official said. He noted that America_„Žs share of NATO spending during the Cold War was 50 percent, but after 1989 it steadily rose to become nearly 75 percent. European nations were enjoying the benefits of Article V guarantees, _„ñbe they security guarantees or headquarters billets _„î but don_„Žt want to share the risks and the costs,_„ he said. In other words, America was getting ripped off.  Advertisement  That was Secretary of Defense Robert Gates speaking almost exactly seven years ago.  Advertisement  Gates noted that he was only the latest in a long succession of U.S. defense secretaries who had complained and cajoled NATO allies on these issues privately and publicly. _„ñThe blunt reality is that there will be dwindling appetite and patience in the U.S. Congress _„î and in the American body politic writ large _„î to expend increasingly precious funds on behalf of nations that are apparently unwilling to devote the necessary resources or make the necessary changes to be serious and capable partners in their own defense,_„ Gates said.  Gates was speaking these words in the context of an ailing NATO mission in Libya. France had been leading the diplomatic effort to convince Allies to take action there. But, Gates said, the U.S. quickly discovered that European militaries were incapable of meaningfully contributing to a mission that was in their own neighborhood. The failures of that mission arguably contributed to the Mediterranean migration crisis that has roiled Europe and re-ordered its politics. They also likely influenced President Obama_„Žs decision not to intervene even more dramatically in the Syrian Civil War in 2013 _„î a wise pull back from the abyss in my own view. Is was also arguably Europe_„Žs own neighborhood. Syria certainly proved to be of vital interest to Europe in the coming years, as the war created a humanitarian crisis on the continent. But Europe_„Žs own interventions in Syria_„Žs civil war have been minuscule, dwarfed by what the Russians were able to do for their client Bashar al-Assad. Only the U.K. and France have contributed anything of substance.  Now Gates_„Žs prediction that patience would begin to run out is coming true, as President Donald Trump reams out the Europeans. Given the increasing exasperation of U.S. presidents, Europe should have anticipated this problem. First, the U.S. cajoled. Then, under Obama it began to warn. And now, under Trump, it bellows. The U.S. is letting Europe know that it can treat this partnership for what it_„Žs worth.  Advertisement  It is time for Europe to grow up. Many of the criticisms their publics, their press, and their politicians throw at Trump and America have some merit. It_„Žs true that Trump is undiplomatic and he can be obnoxious to allies. Many Europeans are currently advertising their revulsion at Trump_„Žs family-separation and detention policies at the border. Those policies deserve criticism.  But, Europe is the continent whose migration policies have turned Libya into a smuggler_„Žs paradise. It was European migration policies that tolerated the sordid Calais jungle. It was Europe that recently cut a deal with the petty tyrant Erdogan to keep migrants out. And it is Europe that is preparing to set up encampments outside its borders to deal with migrants. What do you think those will look like?  Europe is lashing out as it is discovering the truth about what the U.S. really thinks of it.  The continent has real problems and real security challenges. It has real self-regard and sees its political union as a means of putting itself back at the center of the world_„Žs affairs. But, in truth, it has almost no ability to project its power domestically, much less abroad. Only France seems able to maintain its sordid Africa policies.  Sometimes friendships turn toxic. And like anyone who has been enabled and enfeebled by a relationship, Europe is lashing out as it is discovering the truth about what the U.S. really thinks of it. Let it lash out for a bit. This is a partnership based on deep ties of history, civilization, and mutual interests, and one side of it really does have to grow up, and make decisions like an adult."
1556,7/12/18,Analysis Stephen Collinson,https://www.cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/12/politics/trump-nato-putin/index.html?platform=hootsuite,"(CNN) The big takeaway of the so far bad-tempered NATO summit is that President Donald Trump has little time for the alliance and a thin appreciation of the track record and historic purpose of an organization that has kept the peace and preserved Western democracy since World War II.  He has given no sign he sees the alliance as other US presidents did, as a way of projecting American power, fortifying democracy, containing German expansionism and holding Russia at bay on a continent where twice last century, thousands of American boys went to die.  Instead, he appears to view it more like a contracting service, in which US allies should be paying far more in cash for the privilege of being America's friend. If he sees any flow-back benefit to membership for the United States, the President rarely mentions it.  ""I felt the President treated the NATO allies almost with contempt,"" former US Ambassador to NATO Nicholas Burns told CNN's Erin Burnett Wednesday after a day in which Trump berated US partners over defense spending and singled out Germany for particular scorn.  ""It is important that we not normalize this. He is the first American president since Harry Truman ... to not believe that NATO is central to American national security interests.""  With such attacks, Trump also often appears to be doing Russian President Vladimir Putin's work for him, by opening divisions in the transatlantic alliance and berating NATO partners. It's a move even more curious ahead of Trump's Helsinki summit scheduled for Monday with his Russian counterpart.  The question with which NATO leaders must wrestle as the summit ends is whether Trump's clear and public doubts about the alliance's purpose matter.  Trump signed off on a robust set of summit achievements on Wednesday via a communiquÍ© that condemned Russia's ""aggressive"" actions and reaffirmed Western values of freedom and human rights. The alliance invited Macedonia to join and set up a readiness initiative that could quickly deploy troops, planes and ships in any crisis.  And every NATO member is increasing defense spending, something Trump has focused on pushing for.  None of that suggests that NATO is about to collapse despite Trump's antipathy.  This is not the first time the alliance's purpose has been questioned. After the Cold War, NATO was looking for a mission, and it found one in the Balkans and in Afghanistan, until Russia's resurgent threat underlined the need for a transatlantic security alliance.  Yet Trump is the most important leader in NATO, so putting his behavior down as just the rhetoric of an arbitrary disrupter isn't giving him his due. He is the person who would ultimately have to take the decision to react if there were any incursion by Russia into NATO territory.  Would he find it in America's interests to stand up to a provocation by Moscow, especially if it is against a NATO member he considers has not been paying its way? Any ambivalence about a NATO country's fate is critical, since the entire credibility of the grouping rests on the certainty that an attack on one is an attack on all.  How Trump would react if pushed in that capacity is unknown. But for now, he's made his feelings about the current state of the organization and the world's balance of power abundantly clear.  'What good is NATO'  Just before showing up on a mild summer evening in Brussels for an awkward photo-op with world leaders, Trump issued a tweet that explained everything.  ""What good is NATO,"" the blast began, before lashing Germany and other allies that Trump accuses of leeching off American generosity and stinting on their own defense.  ""Many countries are not paying what they should. And frankly, many countries owe us a tremendous amount of money for many years back, where they're delinquent, as far as I'm concerned,"" Trump had said in front of NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg earlier Wednesday.  One shocked senior European diplomat told CNN's Michelle Kosinski: ""It's like the world gone crazy this morning. Trump's performance was beyond belief.""  In apparently rejecting traditional US reverence for the transatlantic alliance, Trump is departing from the views of many senior members of his own administration and military establishment, 97 US senators who voted on Tuesday to support NATO in a pre-emptive swipe against him, and the other 28 members of the alliance.  Even House Speaker Paul Ryan, who is usually loath to criticize Trump, told reporters: ""NATO is indispensable. It's as important today as it ever has been.""  The White House, trying to put a strategic spin on what seems to be Trump's instinctive dislike of NATO, argues that he is actually trying to bolster the alliance with his demands for more defense spending.  ""President Trump wants to see our allies share more of the burden and at a very minimum meet their already stated obligations,"" White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said. Another senior official said the President's attacks on Germany represented ""tough medicine"" for a crucial US ally that's well below the guideline of 2% of gross domestic product for member state spending on defense by 2024.  Trump is not the first president to complain that the US is not getting a fair shake, and his complaints can be easily justified. But the argument that he is acting out of an altruistic desire to make the alliance more effective might be more convincing if the President ever openly praised NATO.  He did not in his public appearances Wednesday invoke NATO's role in keeping Europe free and the Soviet Union at bay. Last year, he practically had to be forced by his staff to reinforce NATO's core Article 5 clause on collective defense. While he berates US partners for the debt they owe to the US, Trump rarely mentions that the only time Article 5 was invoked was to defend the US after the 9/11 attacks and doesn't often acknowledge the deaths of hundreds of soldiers from NATO nations in America's wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.  ""It makes me think that the fundamental purpose of NATO either isn't understood or is being pushed aside,"" David Priess, a former CIA officer who is now a political commentator and author, said on CNN. ""The first NATO secretary-general famously said that the purpose of NATO was to keep the Soviet Union out, the Americans in and the Germans down.""  ""The President seems to have corrupted that to be build the Russians up, get the Americans out and put the Germans down,"" Priess added.  There has certainly been no sign from the President that he subscribes to the philosophy of Harry Truman, the President instrumental in establishing the US-led post-World War II international order that Trump often seems to be trying to tear down.  ""We shall not realize our objectives, however, unless we are willing to help free peoples to maintain their free institutions and their national integrity against aggressive movements that seek to impose upon them totalitarian regimes,"" Truman said in laying out his doctrine of US leadership in 1947.  Trump's hostility to Truman's principles horrified Burns.  ""This is a radical revolution. It is hurting America,"" he said.  Taking aim at Germany  Trump's assault on Germany was particularly astonishing given that it was unprompted and erupted in what had been expected to be a routine breakfast photo-op with Stoltenberg.  He complained about the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, a Russian-owned project that Germany uses to buy gas from Moscow and that the Obama administration also worried was a national security liability and gave significant leverage to the Kremlin.  ""So we protect you against Russia, but they're paying billions of dollars to Russia, and I think that's very inappropriate,"" Trump said, exaggerating the proportion of Germany's energy the pipeline supplies. ""Germany is a captive of Russia,"" he said.  The comment was typical of the way that Trump sometimes states mainstream US opinion in such an explosive manner that it eviscerates diplomatic convention and erupts into huge controversies.  The President's antipathy for German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has often been referred to as a guardian of Western values in the Trump era, is well known. He often berated her on the campaign trail, and her position as the most important leader in the European Union made her a personal target of his trade rhetoric, which has escalated into a tariff war.  But it is difficult to think of a more offensive personal insult to Merkel than Trump's captive jab. The German leader grew up behind the Iron Curtain in Soviet-dominated East Germany and made the building of a plural, democratic political system her life's work.  ""I have witnessed this myself, that a part of Germany was controlled by the Soviet Union. And I am very happy that we are today unified in freedom as the Federal Republic of Germany,"" Merkel said, responding to Trump's attack later on Wednesday.  Trump's attack on the German leader -- perhaps motivated by her weakened political state back home, could be an attempt to insulate himself from criticism that he is under the influence of Putin before their summit -- bewildered his critics in the United States.  Former Secretary of State John Kerry said the criticism of Germany was ""disgraceful"" and ""destructive."" In a joint statement, top congressional Democrats Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York and Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California said it was ""an ""embarrassment.""  ""His behavior this morning is another profoundly disturbing signal that the President is more loyal to President Putin than to our NATO allies,"" they wrote.  ""You can express yourself without trying to tear down an alliance that's been important to the security of Americans,"" he told CNN's Manu Raju."

Japan had recently announced its nuclear weapons program in the wake of the United States withdrawing from the Korean peninsula after a peace treaty was signed to end the Korean war, even though North Korea maintained its nuclear weapons.

Foreign policy often moves slowly, with ramifications only visible months or years later: when the US assisted the South Vietnam government in the 1950s, few could see the 58,000 American military dead in the Vietnam war; as the US helped overthrow the democratically elected leader of Iran in 1953, it was difficult to see the 1979 revolution that resulted in a dictatorship that would become America_„Žs main enemy in the Middle East; and too few officials saw that invading Iraq in 2003 would blow up the entire Middle East.

If current trends continue, today we may be present at the destruction of the geopolitical system that was ushered in after the second world war and secured after the cold war.  Events have moved quickly. After starting a trade war with America_„Žs closest democratic allies, Trump became the first US president to refuse to sign a statement of the G7 at the June meeting in Canada, which he followed by calling the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, _„ñdishonest & weak_„. Canada and Europe have shot back with retaliatory tariffs, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, said that the other G7 democracies will uphold democratic principles regardless of America, and the German foreign minister called for a European strategy to counter Trump_„Žs policies.

Photograph: Jesco Denzel/AFP/Getty Images  Straight from the G7 debacle, Trump flew to Singapore for a first-ever meeting between a sitting US president and the leader of North Korea. In the course of his meeting, Trump unilaterally agreed to freeze US-South Korean joint military exercises _„_ a longtime demand of North Korea and China _„_ without consulting the US ally South Korea, and without getting anything in return. This came after a report of Trump trying to withdraw troops from South Korea. While Trump got nothing more from the summit than a photo op with perhaps the world_„Žs most brutal dictator, Trump emulated Kim Jong-un, saying: _„ñHe speaks and his people sit up at attention _„_ I want my people to do the same._„  Last week, Trump continued the abdication of American leadership and principles at the Nato summit, saying, _„ñWhat good is Nato _„__„, and reportedly threatened to pull the United States out of Nato if other countries don_„Žt spend more on defense.

Despite all of Russia_„Žs aggression towards the US and Europe, Trump repeatedly sides with Putin over America_„Žs own interests and allies  Next in Hurricane Trump_„Žs path was the United Kingdom, where Trump was met with massive protests. Trump criticized Theresa May_„Žs approach to Brexit at the same time that her government faces a Brexit crisis.

President Trump kowtowed to Vladimir Putin, praising the Russian leader as a potential partner and casting doubt on accusations of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.  But the thing that made it not just disgraceful but actively terrifying was the timing.  Last week, Trump attended a NATO summit, where he met with America_„Žs top allies in Western Europe to discuss (among other things) the threat from Putin_„Žs Russia. Trump spent the meeting bashing American allies for not spending enough on their own defense, labeling the Western alliance _„ñdelinquent._„ Shortly afterward, he gave interviews slamming the UK prime minister and labeling the European Union a _„foe._„  The contrast with the Putin press conference, in which Trump vowed to build an _„ñextraordinary relationship_„ with Russia, couldn_„Žt be clearer. In fact, the same day as the fawning Putin presser, the Trump administration brought a World Trade Organization suit alleging that the bulk of NATO allies are engaging in unfair trade practices against the United States.  We all kind of knew this is how Trump felt, since at least the campaign. But Monday_„Žs Trump-Putin summit, and the NATO summit before it, showed that he was serious about turning those feelings into action. Trump has, in the past week, said and done several things that concretely undermine the US_„Žs relationship with Western Europe while at the same time ingratiating himself with Putin.  We must confront the reality that the world_„Žs worst fears about a Trump presidency are starting to come true: that America under Trump is committing what Georgetown University professor Dan Nexon calls _„ñgeopolitical suicide._„ The Trump administration is ending _„ñAmerica_„ as we know it _„î a country that basically works to maintain a relatively peaceful status quo _„î and replacing it with a kind of rogue superpower, one that is willing to advance what Donald Trump sees as its interests at any cost.  The world is now going to come to terms with the Trump threat  Within half an hour of arriving at the NATO summit last week, Trump insulted German Chancellor Angela Merkel and forced NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg to publicly sing his praises. Trump later derailed meetings with his complaints about allies not spending enough on defense, forcing Stoltenberg to call an emergency session to mediate between Trump and the rest of the alliance. Afterward, Trump claimed that NATO allies had capitulated to him and agreed to spend more on defense _„î a claim disputed by, among others, French President Emmanuel Macron.  That_„Žs an extremely contentious approach to allies, one that indicates Trump_„Žs willingness to pursue his disagreements with them. The tariffs brought earlier this year, and the WTO case brought on Monday, shows that he_„Žs willing, perhaps even eager, to back up these complaints with concrete action. The ultimate goal appears to be to change the way America_„Žs relationship with its allies works, both militarily and economically.  Yet during his press conference with Putin, Trump gave no indication that he was willing to pursue US grievances with Russia in a similar fashion. He didn_„Žt mention the recent revelation that Russia had poisoned two UK civilians during a chemical weapons attack on Britain. He didn_„Žt bring up the war in Ukraine, nor did he mention the hundreds of times NATO forces have had to scramble to meet Russian warplanes in Europe over the past several years.  At times, it felt like Trump was actively running interference for the Russian president. When a reporter asked who was responsible for poor US-Russian relations of late, Trump suggested that both sides bore some blame and that it was time to let bygones be bygones:  I hold both countries responsible. I think the United States has been foolish. I think we have all been foolish. We should have had this dialogue a long time ago, a long time frankly before I got to office. I think we_„Žre all to blame. I think that the United States now has stepped forward along with Russia. We_„Žre getting together and we have a chance to do some great things.  So Trump is willing to publicly confront US allies on defense spending, humiliating the assembled heads of state at a NATO summit. He_„Žs willing to hit the EU with tariffs and WTO suits over (allegedly) unfair trade practices. Yet when given a massive platform to confront Vladimir Putin over a series of very real attacks on the United States and its allies, Trump actually defended the Russian leader.  There is, at least for now, no mismatch between Trump_„Žs rhetoric and actions. The Trump administration_„Žs policy is being brought in line with candidate Trump_„Žs rhetoric.  Trump the revisionist  When scholars of international relations analyze the strategies of great powers like the United States, they typically describe these countries_„Ž objectives as falling into one of two buckets. Either they are _„ñstatus quo_„ powers, nations that largely want to keep the world working the way it already does, or they are _„ñrevisionist_„ powers that want to upend the balance of power.  Nazi Germany is the classic revisionist power, as it sought to conquer all of Western Europe. Prewar Britain was a classic status quo power, trying to maintain its own empire and keep Hitler from gobbling up everyone else.  For the past several decades, the United States has largely behaved like a status quo power. The US has long been the world_„Žs richest, most militarily powerful, and most diplomatically influential country on Earth; the centerpiece of its global strategy has been to maintain this position of strength. That_„Žs why the US didn_„Žt tear up the NATO alliance after its original reason for existing, the threat from the Soviet Union, ended; being in a tight military alliance with a number of the world_„Žs wealthiest and most powerful countries helped the US cement its dominance and deter potential rivals from challenging American power.  Russia under Putin is perhaps the world_„Žs most ambitious revisionist power. Putin_„Žs goal is to make Russia the kind of world power it was during the Soviet era; he_„Žs been willing to aggressively deploy the Russian military (in Ukraine and Syria) and intelligence services (in Western Europe and the United States) in service of this aim. This fundamental tension, between Moscow_„Žs revisionism and Washington_„Žs defense of the status quo, led to a collapse in US-Russia relations during the late Obama administration.  But Trump thinks like a revisionist. When he looks at the NATO alliance, he doesn_„Žt see a network of American allies; he sees a group of freeloaders exploiting American might to slack off on defending themselves. When he looks at the global economy, he doesn_„Žt see America_„Žs privileged position as the world_„Žs largest economy; he sees a once-great country laid low by foreigners exploiting its generous trade practices. Trump doesn_„Žt want to preserve the global status quo; he wants to revise it.  This worldview puts him in objective alignment with Putin, who has similar _„î albeit more radical _„î feelings about the Western alliance. This is likely one reason Putin interfered in the US election to back Trump in the first place; it was plausible, even back in early 2016, to predict that a Trump presidency could destabilize the US-led global order in exactly the ways Putin hoped for.  This notion, that the world_„Žs most powerful country might actually try to shake up the global order that sustains its power, is deeply stupid, which is why Georgetown_„Žs Nexon labeled it _„ñgeopolitical suicide_„ in the first place. It_„Žs so stupid, in fact, that many observers predicted that Trump couldn_„Žt possibly act on his anti-ally and pro-Russia rhetoric once in office.  Yet the past week has shown that Trump is, in fact, serious about trying to commit superpower seppuku.

Trump's critique referred to the controversial $12 billion proposed Nord Stream 2 pipeline between Russia and Germany.  Kerry quickly blasted the president on social media, calling Trump_„Žs comments _„ñstrange_„ and _„ñcounterproductive_„ _„î and declaring _„ñthe president set America back._„  _„ñPresident Trump makes public adversaries out of our friends, and turns our adversary, who has been attacking America_„Žs democracy, into his fawned-over ally,_„ Kerry said.  _„ñWhy? Why would an American president whose first NATO meeting last year was a disaster, show up in Belgium this year just to prove he doesn_„Žt understand how vital alliances have made a huge difference for the security of the United States and the lives of Europeans?_„ Kerry added.  My thoughts on President Trump's remarks in Brussels this morning: pic.twitter.com/x0k3k0lOkA _„î John Kerry (@JohnKerry) July 11, 2018  Trump has not responded to Kerry.  Kerry praised President Barack Obama saying: ""He displays a woeful ignorance of the work his predecessor_„Žs administration did to increase European defense spending.""  _„ñPresident Obama raised the issue in a constructive and collegial way that succeeded in securing a pledge from NATO members to increase their defense spending, without undermining the cohesion of the alliance in the process,_„ said Kerry who served as the top diplomat during the Obama administration.  Kerry also added he and President Obama used different tactics to resolve the issue on foreign contributions and placing sanctions against Russia.  _„ñPresident Obama and I worked hard using effective diplomacy _„î not bombast and demagoguery _„î to secure those sanctions in the first place._„"
