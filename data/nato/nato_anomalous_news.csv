10,http://insider.foxnews.com,http://insider.foxnews.com/2018/07/12/piers-morgan-rips-obama-and-talks-trump-nato-and-london-queen,"English journalist Piers Morgan reacted to his country's public displays of protest against President Donald Trump and its love for former President Barack Obama.  ""He's a rare president,"" Morgan, editor-in-chief of Daily Mail, said. ""[Trump has] a complete revulsion of what he sees as conventional political posturing.""  Morgan also told Martha MacCallum that Obama is seen as a ""saintly figure"" in much of the United Kingdom, while many detest Trump.  However, Morgan invited Britons to take a closer look at their love for Obama: ""He deported three million illegal immigrants... [and] kept Guantanamo Bay open for eight years.""  ""If [Britons] actually looked at him pragmatically, what did he actually achieve?"" Morgan asked.  'Control Yourself...

Morgan said that, much like the United States is polarized between the liberal coasts and more conservative Middle America, Britain becomes less progressive as you move north from liberal London.  MacCallum noted that London is where much of the anti-Trump protests are taking place.  Morgan said that Trump is definitively honored to be meeting Queen Elizabeth II, who he said was one of the president's Scotch-born mother Mary's ""idols.""

General Tod Wolters, also the NATO Allied Air Commander, told Reuters the issue was worrying, but he was working to maintain strong military ties with the NATO member for now.  ""Anything that an S-400 can do that affords it the ability to better understand a capability like the F-35 is certainly not to the advantage of the coalition,"" said Wolters, who was in Britain for an air chiefs conference in London and the Royal International Air Tattoo at RAF Fairford.  U.S. and NATO officials want to prevent the Russian-built defense system from accumulating information about Lockheed Martin F-35 fighter jets just as they are gaining a foothold in Europe.  Norway, Britain and Italy will have a total of 40 F-35s in Europe by the end of the year, with 24 more to be delivered next year and the Netherlands to receive two jets as well, according to a spokesman for the U.S. Air Force.  Turkey's plans to buy the Russian air and missile defense system have raised tensions with Washington, and U.S. lawmakers are seeking to block the transfer of any F-35 jets to Turkey.  A senior U.S. official last month said Turkey was a key NATO ally, but its purchases of the F-35 would be at risk and Ankara would face sanctions if it proceeded to buy the S-400.  Ankara received its first F-35 jet at the Lockheed plant in Texas last month, although the aircraft will stay in the United States for training.  ""The Turks have to make a choice. They're either going to be part of NATO or they're going to move into the Russian camp in terms of defense,"" said David Deptula, a retired Air Force general and industry consultant.  He said NATO would never integrate an S-400 system into its integrated air defense system because it would give the Russian-built system data about operating tactics and procedures that could be transferred to other users.  Operating an F-35 nearby would also allow the S-400 system to glean key information about range of detection and other characteristics of the aircraft, potentially undermining any element of surprise.  Wolters said NATO was worried about ""how much, for how long and how close"" any F-35s would be operated near the S-400 systems. ""All those would have to be determined. We do know for right now it is a challenge.""  But he said his contacts with the Turkish air force remained ""rock solid"" despite the dispute over the S-400, focusing on current security threats.  ""For right now, all the conversations surrounding that challenge have not hindered at all the strong relationship that we have with the Turkish air force and the great alliance that the two nations have together,"" he said. ""We want to make sure that for now we're continuing on that path.""  (Reporting by Andrea Shalal; Editing by Mark Potter)"

Taxpayers vented their fury on social media, with many unhappy that the British public will be billed for what some described as a 'private trip'.  Wilma McEwan said: 'If Donald Trump wants to visit Scotland should he not pay for that visit himself? That ‘£5million earmarked for the scrounger would feed a good few families for a long time.'  Laura Smith added: 'He's only coming up here to play golf anyway! That's his own free time for which he should pay for/provide his OWN security!'  Alistair Wilson agreed, remarking: '‘£5,000 on police costs so that Trump can play golf as a private citizen? Imagine how few police are protecting Scotland today.'  Donald Trump (pictured on his course is Ayrshire) may have cost the taxpayer ‘£5million by visiting his resort in Scotland  Trump has two courses in Scotland _„_ the Trump Turnberry golf resort in Ayrshire, and Menie in Aberdeenshire.  Chief Secretary to the Treasury Li Truss confirmed earlier this month that the government had earmarked ‘£5million for Scottish trip by the US President.  This is just less than the astonishing ‘£6.35million the Metropolitan Police spent on security at the wedding of Kate Middleton and Prince William in 2011.  She tweeted at the time: 'I have confirmed that should President Trump visit Scotland, we would provide funding to the Scottish Government to cover the policing costs incurred.'  Officials in Scotland fear he may be avoiding personal costs for a business trip by including visits to his resorts within the presidential itinerary.  Social media users were outraged by Trump's visit, claiming he was a 'private citizen' and that it was an 'abuse of tax payer money'  One man suggested Scotland should bill Trump for his stay, writing: 'It would be a good thing to get exact costs and published receipts of just how much money was spent at Trump's Scotland County Club. Every penny. We're getting tired of having our noses rubbed in it.'  Les Clarke agreed: 'I hope they hand Trump the bill for the costs of his security at least for covering his golfing weekend it Scotland, with the caveat, pay up (cash in advance - no rubber cheques) or we'll send the security home now!'  Scotland's new Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf write to UK Home Secretary Sajid Javid, saying the country does not want to settle the bill.  He tweeted: 'He is coming as a guest as the UK government, they must not leave Police Scotland with a ‘£5m bill.'  In the letter, he said while the final details 'for any potential visit to Scotland are yet to be confirmed, you will be aware that extensive operational planning is now underway given the imminent timing.'  Other taxpayers suggested Trump should be billed for the total amount of his visit to Scotland, which they claimed was purely for 'leisure'  Mr Yousaf said that at a meeting of the Scottish Police Authority, senior Police Scotland officers indicated that costs 'in the region of ‘£5 million are likely to be incurred'.  In the lead up to Trump's visit Chief Constable of Police Scotland Iain Livingstone warned the Scottish Police Authority that 'we will have to utilize over 5,000 conventional officers, along with public order officer, specialised search and firearms resources'.  It is unclear how much of the ‘£5million has been used to pay for the ring of steel that surround the US President's Ayrshire golf course where he is currently staying.  US President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump arrive at the Trump Turnberry resort in South Ayrshire. Taxpayers have been outraged by the likely ‘£5million cost of policing his visit"

The castle is a metaphor for their nation. The foreign powers?  Well, from the 20th century, take your pick. First it was the Russians. Then the Germans. Then the Russians again. Only in the last quarter-century has Latvia been able to reclaim its nationhood, and only in the last decade has it felt secure in that claim.  The security came from one thing: joining NATO, an alliance of nations forged after the fires of World War II and expanded during the Cold War as a buffer against Soviet aggression.  Now, with Russia once again on the prowl, that alliance seems to be at risk in ways that were virtually inconceivable when Latvia joined in 2004."

514,https://www.bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-44837612,"Image copyright EPA Image caption A suicide bombing earlier this month killed more than a dozen people in the Afghan city of Jalalabad  The number of civilians killed in the long-running war in Afghanistan reached a record high in the first six months of this year, the UN says.  Some 1,692 fatalities were recorded, with militant attacks and suicide bombs said to be the leading causes of death.  The report comes as at at least seven people were killed in an attack on the rural development ministry in Kabul.  Recent attacks claimed by Taliban and Islamic State group militants have killed scores across the country.  The figures for the conflict, which began in 2001, are the highest since the UN started keeping records in 2009.  The report, by the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (Unama), says the number of recorded deaths rose by 1% compared with the same period last year.  However, the report adds, injuries fell by 5% to 3,430, and the total number of civilian casualties - accounting for deaths and injuries - dropped by 3% to 5,122.  The record high death toll came despite an unprecedented ceasefire by Afghan security forces and the Taliban last month, which was largely respected by both sides, Unama said.  Earlier this month, Nato leaders gathered at a summit in Brussels to discuss the conflict in Afghanistan.  The US has said it is planning a strategic review a year after President Donald Trump agreed to remain involved in the 17-year conflict.  The US-led invasion drove the hardline Taliban from power in 2001, as part of a crackdown on Islamist militants after the 9/11 attacks in the US.  Thousands of Nato troops were deployed and a long, bloody conflict followed as the ousted militants fought back.  In 2014, Nato formally ended the combat mission, handing over to Afghan forces, whom it had trained.  Since then, the Taliban have made substantial territorial gains across the country."

Footage from the summit on Wednesday shows the 63-year-old being held up as he makes his way down the stairs.  But as Mr Juncker attempts to walk he stumbles backwards and loses his balance once again.  The European Commission President then had to be held at the arm in an effort to steady himself.  Prime Minister Theresa May walked past Mr Juncker and grinned, seemingly unaware that the European Commission President was struggling to stand unaided."

Nearly 500 people, including children and the elderly, left the Shebaa area in southeast Lebanon in 15 buses for the Beit Jinn district in Syria, southwest of Damascus, which was recaptured from rebels by pro-government forces in December. The buses reached the Lebanese border on Wednesday afternoon before crossing into Syria.  _„ñWe had no news about our hometown. My family and I are happy to be going back,_„ said Younes Othman, 31, who was a farmer in Syria and is returning after four years in Lebanon.  The convoy was organized by the Lebanese authorities, Lebanon_„Žs state news agency NNA reported. The U.N. refugee agency UNHCR, in a statement, said it was not involved in organizing _„ñthese returns or other returns at this point, considering the prevailing humanitarian and security situation in Syria_„.  More than half of Syria_„Žs pre-war population have fled their homes since the outbreak of war in 2011, including more than a million who sought refuge in tiny Lebanon, where they now make up more than a quarter of the population.  Some leading Lebanese politicians, including President Michel Aoun, have called for Syrian refugees to return to calmer parts of Syria, but the United Nations says they should not be forced to go back."

The real thing just pulls down his slacks and s**ts wherever and over whomever he so pleases.  But it does mean that, the morning after using The Sun newspaper to soil the special relationship to such an extent that frankly the bin is the only place for it, those gathered at Chequers for the joint press conference between the prime minister and her theoretically closest ally were treated to a wonderfully cathartic spectacle. This was the sight of a toddler, knowing it has shat itself with thermonuclear effect, mounting an embarrassed attempt to clean up the mess itself, and with entirely predictable results.  Because a mess of this kind can only be cleared up with something absorbent. You can_„Žt stomp up and down in it and expect it to go away. You can_„Žt, as the president attempted, pick it up and throw it at other people in the hope that everyone might think it was their s**t not yours to begin with.  And you also can_„Žt clean it up by just pointing at it and claiming it isn_„Žt there.  That the day had been choreographed to bear every outward resemblance to a wedding and was instead a curious Jeremy Kyle/Jerry Springer mash-up on _„ñLate Life Forced Marriages Go Wrong_„ was unfortunate.

greater reason than she happens to be the last person he spoke to.  The Sun_„Žs interview, recorded, filmed and published in full online, was _„ñfake news_„.  The special relationship had been elevated to _„ñthe highest level of special_„ and as the prime minister stood there and grimaced for almost a full hour, the president made her fall in love all over again by pushing her under every available bus that came by.  He had, he said, tried to apologise for the interview last night, and was told by Theresa May, _„ñDon_„Žt worry, it_„Žs only the press._„ The press laughed. They won_„Žt forget that quickly.  As for the bombshell interview itself, the president did his level best to set the truth out into the grand garden like the snitch in Quidditch, somehow impossible to find, but it didn_„Žt pay off.  Donald Trump stood there, telling reporters, for example, _„ñYes I said Boris Johnson would make a great prime minister, but I also said this wonderful lady here is doing a fantastic job._„  Yet four rows into the audience right in front of him, the journalist from The Sun who did the interview, just said to himself and to others, _„ñNo you didn_„Žt._„  And the president has promised to make the transcripts available, too, so we_„Žll see who_„Žs right and one suspects the answer won_„Žt shock anyone.  Nato, we learned, had been left _„ñstronger_„ and _„ñmore powerful_„ than ever, by virtue of its members being told they must meet their 2024 spending targets by January or else risk the United States pulling out. To meet those targets is politically impossible.  European leaders can_„Žt be bullied into vast spending commitments by a disliked president and keep their support. It is being pushed into a crisis by the man standing right there, saying it is all fine thanks to him, and anything else is ""fake news"".  And as for Brexit, he repeated several times he had given Theresa May _„ña suggestion_„ for what to do and it would be up to her if she took it. Quite what _„ñthe suggestion_„ was, he never made clear. It seems to take on a life of its own, as if _„ñthe suggestion_„ might be carried around in a briefcase by Samuel L Jackson and John Travolta, only the very luckiest ever catching a glimpse of it.  That the most powerful man in the world nevertheless has skin so thin it can be punctured from whole counties away, means that 90 per cent of the Trump visit had to be conducted as an air operation. Not so long ago, President Trump once claimed he wouldn_„Žt hesitate before running unarmed into the middle of a high school shooting, so why the entirety of his UK visit still had to occur at least 50 miles away from a protest featuring a 20ft-high balloon replica of him is something of a mystery.  But his incessant helicoptering in and out of London and Windsor and Blenheim and Chequers at least had the advantage of making obvious the most appropriate metaphor for it.  It was an aerial assault. The president of the United States hovered above Britain, took a dump, then switched the blades of his V-22 tiltrotor escort aircraft to fixed wing mode and sped off to Putin.  Whether the president knew the severity of what he was doing in his interview with The Sun, when he told Theresa May she had ruined the Brexit negotiations, and a US trade deal was off the table, is the key subject of much debate.  When asked a question does he just say the first thought in his head, his geo-politically world-altering opinions formed only to fill the silence? Or is it part of a concerted strategy to undermine Nato, and undermine the EU as a large trading bloc that for as long as it sticks together has the muscle to match America?  The answer is almost certainly both. But the diplomatic world is a delicate place. Normal people always wonder why politicians appear to move heaven and earth not to say anything, not to give a straight answer to a straight question. Donald Trump amply demonstrates at least part of the answer. The world needs alliances between democratic countries, and those alliances can_„Žt survive if they undermine one another, if the leaders are politically sabotaged and weakened by their friends walking other corridors of power.  To see Donald Trump up close is to watch your house being trashed in real time over CCTV. The only question is whether someone can put a stop to it before the damage is irrevocable. Six more years of this and there will only be s**t left to s**t on."

I am not drunk. I have sciatica. I would prefer to be drunk,"" he said of the condition in an address at the Irish parliament last month.  Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa said on Thursday that Juncker had complained of back pain.

On Wednesday, the newly-elected Progressive Conservative government of Premier Doug Ford announced the sex-ed curriculum to be taught to children in the coming school year will be an older version _„î not the controversial updated program brought in by the previous government.  The curriculum will revert back to the version taught in 1998, excluding recently added topics such as same-sex marriage, masturbation, online bullying and sexting.  ""It's infuriating to see them do this,"" Glen Canning told CBC Radio's The House on Friday, adding that teaching consent in schools might have made all the difference for his daughter, Rehtaeh Parsons.  In November 2011, the Nova Scotia teen attended a party where she said she was sexually assaulted.  An explicit photo was taken during the incident _„î one that would be spread among the kids at her school and lead to months of online bullying.  Seventeen-year-old Rehtaeh was taken off life support in April 2013 after attempting suicide.  When Rehtaeh Parsons died following a suicide attempt, a national conversation was sparked on how people address sexual assault and consent. The outrage over her death, and what led to it, is still felt five years later, especially in her home community of Cole Harbour, N.S. CBC News spoke to family and friends of Parsons' about her legacy. 4:44  Canning said he believes that if Ontario's modernized _„î and soon to be replaced _„î sex ed curriculum had been in place in Nova Scotia at the time, his daughter might still be alive.  ""I think I'd still have my daughter with me right now.""  Canning said repealing the curriculum means children and teens in Ontario won't learn about topics that can help them feel safer in school _„î like consent, LGBT issues and sexual violence.  He accused Ford of scrapping the curriculum to appease his party's socially-conservative voters.  Ford's new education minister, Lisa Thompson, said the government is planning to consult with parents on a new curriculum to replace the one adopted in 2015.  But Canning said too many parents are failing to teach their kids the facts about sex, sexual exploitation and bullying now. If schools and parents fail to address these topics properly, he said, more teens will suffer the way his daughter did.  ""What happened to my daughter was preventable ... it was preventable with a good sex education program."""

1280,https://en.wikipedia.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_lie,"A big lie (German: groÍ»e LÍ_ge) is a propaganda technique. The expression was coined by Adolf Hitler, when he dictated his 1925 book Mein Kampf, about the use of a lie so ""colossal"" that no one would believe that someone ""could have the impudence to distort the truth so infamously."" Hitler believed the technique was used by Jews to blame Germany's loss in World War I on German general Erich Ludendorff, who was a prominent nationalist and antisemitic political leader in the Weimar Republic.  Hitler's use of the expression [ edit ]  The source of the Big Lie technique is this passage, taken from Chapter 10 of James Murphy's translation of Mein Kampf:  But it remained for the Jews, with their unqualified capacity for falsehood, and their fighting comrades, the Marxists, to impute responsibility for the downfall precisely to the man who alone had shown a superhuman will and energy in his effort to prevent the catastrophe which he had foreseen and to save the nation from that hour of complete overthrow and shame. By placing responsibility for the loss of the world war on the shoulders of Ludendorff they took away the weapon of moral right from the only adversary dangerous enough to be likely to succeed in bringing the betrayers of the Fatherland to Justice. All this was inspired by the principle_„îwhich is quite true within itself_„îthat in the big lie there is always a certain force of credibility; because the broad masses of a nation are always more easily corrupted in the deeper strata of their emotional nature than consciously or voluntarily; and thus in the primitive simplicity of their minds they more readily fall victims to the big lie than the small lie, since they themselves often tell small lies in little matters but would be ashamed to resort to large-scale falsehoods. It would never come into their heads to fabricate colossal untruths, and they would not believe that others could have the impudence to distort the truth so infamously. Even though the facts which prove this to be so may be brought clearly to their minds, they will still doubt and waver and will continue to think that there may be some other explanation. For the grossly impudent lie always leaves traces behind it, even after it has been nailed down, a fact which is known to all expert liars in this world and to all who conspire together in the art of lying. Adolf Hitler, Mein Kampf, vol. I, ch. X[1]  According to Hitler, the ""Big Lie"" was a propaganda technique typically used by ""the Jews"".[1]  Goebbels's use of the expression [ edit ]  Later, Joseph Goebbels put forth a slightly different theory which has come to be more commonly associated with the expression ""big lie"". Goebbels wrote the following paragraph in an article dated 12 January 1941, 16 years after Hitler's first use of the phrase. The article, titled Aus Churchills LÍ_genfabrik (English: ""From Churchill's Lie Factory"") was published in Die Zeit ohne Beispiel.  The essential English leadership secret does not depend on particular intelligence. Rather, it depends on a remarkably stupid thick-headedness. The English follow the principle that when one lies, one should lie big, and stick to it. They keep up their lies, even at the risk of looking ridiculous.[2]  Holocaust [ edit ]  Jeffrey Herf maintains that Goebbels and the Nazis used the Big Lie to turn long-standing anti-semitism into mass murder.[3] Herf argues that the Big Lie was a narrative of an innocent, besieged Germany striking back at an ""international Jewry"", which it said started World War I. The propaganda repeated over and over the conspiracy that Jews were the real powers in Britain, Russia and the U.S. It went on to state that the Jews had begun a ""war of extermination"" against Germany, and so Germany had a duty and a right to ""exterminate"" and ""annihilate"" the Jews in self-defense.[4]  Usage in Hitler's psychological profile [ edit ]  The phrase was also used in a report prepared during the war by the United States Office of Strategic Services in describing Hitler's psychological profile:[5][6]  His primary rules were: never allow the public to cool off; never admit a fault or wrong; never concede that there may be some good in your enemy; never leave room for alternatives; never accept blame; concentrate on one enemy at a time and blame him for everything that goes wrong; people will believe a big lie sooner than a little one; and if you repeat it frequently enough people will sooner or later believe it.[7][8]  The above quote appears in the Nizkor Project's site[9] though the source document is not cited. The source document is available on the cia.gov website and is located at page 46 in the .pdf document and page 38 on the document's numbered pages.[10] The quote does appear in the report, A Psychological Analysis of Adolph Hitler: His Life and Legend, by Walter C. Langer with collaboration by Henry Murray, Ernst Kris and Bertram Lewin,[11][12] which is available from the US National Archives, though it does appear, unreferenced, on page 57 in Langer's ebook by the same title (without mention of the collaborators on his previous work).[13] A somewhat similar quote _„î ""never to admit a fault or wrong; never to accept blame; concentrate on one enemy at a time; blame that enemy for everything that goes wrong; take advantage of every opportunity to raise a political whirlwind"" _„î appears on page 219 in a different report also available from the US National Archive, namely, Analysis of the Personality of Adolph Hitler: With Predictions of His Future Behaviour and Suggestions for Dealing with Him Now and After Germany's Surrender, by Henry A. Murray, October 1943[14] though Murray's work is neither referenced in Langer's ebook nor in the Hitler's Source-Book[15] compiled by Langer and upon which his ebook heavily depends.
