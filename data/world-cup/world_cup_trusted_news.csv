The second phase of the rescue mission saw emergency services battling to reach the boys and their coach from the flooded cave.  The operation was paused yesterday as rain in the Chiang Rai region threatened to raise water levels inside the Tham Luang Nang Non cave once again after four of the boys were brought to the surface on Sunday.  However, rain overnight has not hampered rescue efforts with more boys being brought to the surface this afternoon.  So far four have been rescued today, according to news agency Reuters.  (Image: REX/Shutterstock)  (Image: REUTERS)  Rescuers in northern Thailand have now brought four people out of the cave tonight. The first emerged at 4.30pm (local time). The second at 6pm.  The chief running the rescue operation said some of the first children rescued are being treated in hospital.  One of them was reported to have asked for food after telling authorities, “I’m hungry” and requesting a pad kra pao - a popular Thai meat dish with basil."

One moment, Brazil-born Russian footballer was the hero after his header sent the match against Croatia at the Fisht stadium into the penalties and within minutes, his wayward penalty became one of the reasons the host country's journey in the ongoing ended.  After a late drama that went for way too long, Croatia ended up with a win to take them into the semi-finals of the where they will meet England. Hosts Russia exit the tournament after losing 3-4 on penalties despite giving a spirited performance in which they scored a late equaliser in the extra-time to take the match to the penalties. But Russia, who won on penalties against the mighty Spaniards to eliminate them, couldn't keep their cool this time and now are no more in running for the top prize despite exceeding everybody's expectations with their performances in the tournament.  The first half ended 1-1 with goals from and Andrej Kramaric at either ends. Russia opened the scoring with a Cheryshev wondergoal in the 31st minute, which, to be honest, came out of nowhere. The Villareal brought the ball from deep, played one-twos with Dzyuba down the inside-left channel, received the ball and curled a powerful shot into the top left corner from 25 yards. Croatia got a goal of their own within seven minutes after a good team move and some terrible defending from the Russians. Manduzkic wandered into the box, looked up and picked out Kramaric who sort of crouched to steer a header across Akinfeev and into the bottom right.  The second half was largely uneventful with neither team creating any clear-cut chance. Croatia did come close though when Perisic hit the bar in the 59th minute. Perisic took benefit of the chaos inside the Russian box and took a touch before drilling a low shot towards the left and to the bottom of the post.  The match went to extra-time after the two teams failed to settle the match in the regulation time. The extra 30 minutes gave much more exciting moments than the entire regulation time. First, Croatia took a 2-1 lead with the help of a Domagoj Vida header in the 101st minute. The Crots got a corner and Vida rose on the spot to meet the delivery to send his downward header into the bottom right. With time running out, Russian manager Stanislav Cherchesov appeal the home crowd to back the players who did answer to their countrymen's appeal.  With five more minutes to go of extra time, Russia got a free-kick at the very edge of the box. Alan Dzagoev curled an outswinger into the box and Brazil-born rose the highest and turns his head into the bottom left to equalise and send the match to penalties. All of a sudden, Fernandes was a national hero in his adopted homeland. But that was going to change soon.  Smolov took Russia's first penalty and approached his penalty-kick with the look of a kid going to school for the first time. Unsurprisingly, his tame effort to the left was well-read and saved by Croatia's goalkeeper. For Croatia, Brozovic scored to give them the lead. Russia's Dzagoev converted his penalty too. took Croatia's second penalty but the Real Madrid man's shot was blocked by Akinfeev who guessed correctly and dived to his right. Then came the moment of Fernandes. The right-back, who had, moments before given an entire nation hope, dragged his penalty kick wide amid groans from fans. Croatia's captain Luka Modric took the next penalty and buried it on the low left corner, so did Russia's Ignashevich, and Croatia's Vida, and Russia's Kuziaev. Barcelona's took the final penalty kick for Croatia and slipped his penalty into... the bottom left.  Rakitic, with his trademark celebration of arms wide open, ran towards the crowd and the Croatia team rushed towards him to celebrate. The Russians though were in tears and so were the huge number of fans they had in the stands today.  That's where the dream ends for Russia, who indeed had a dream run to the quarters of a World Cup. Nobody expected them to come this far, but they slew some giants and gave some memorable performances to be in this position. They have been great hosts to this World Cup but they have been a better team. They almost made it through today also against one of the top contenders of the trophy but must feel bitter about having lost on penalties a contest they must have felt was even.  That makes Croatia's last two wins from penalties. They are one of the favoured winners of the World Cup but will have to more than better their performances when they meet England in the semis. If they can do that, the 'golden generation' of the Croatian football can realise their dream of winning a major tournament. But only then. And not like today.  Rakitic scores!! and Croatia win on penalties!!  Russia 3-Croatia 3. Kuziaev rolls his penalty into the bottom left.  Vida lashes his shot into the left to score! Russia 2-Croatia 3  Ignashevic hammers his penalty into the bottom left. Russia 2-Croatia 2.  Luka Modric scores!  Fernandes sends his penalty to I-don't-know-where. His drive on the left goes past the goal-post.  Kovacic's penalty is saved as the Russian keeper dives and improvises mid-way to deflect it.  Dzagoev scores from the spot, puts it into the bottom right!  Braozovic scores with a powerful kick to high on the  right.  Smolov misses! He shoots very tamely to the left and Subasic saves.  Russia will take the first penalty.  --Russia get a free-kick at the very edge of the box. Dzagoev curls an outswinger into the box. Fernandes rises highest, and turns hsi head into the bottom left! Russia equalise!-- Russia get a corner which is half-cleared. The ball falls to Kuziaev who hits it first-time, a hard strike but straight at Subasic who holds on just enough.First half of the extra-time ends. 15 more minutes and if Croatia hold on, they will be in the semis.-- Vida heads Croatia into the lead in the extra-time!! Croatia get a corner and Vida rises on the spot to meet the delivery to send his downward header into the bottom right.  Substitution for Croatia: Corluka for Vraslkjo  ET+ Minute 4: Vrsaljko, who appears to have tweaked something himself, limps off for treatment.  -- Croatia substitution: Kovacic enters the mix for Croatia as Kramaric walks out of the pitch.-- Russia get a free kick. Golovin sends an inswinger into the mixer. Lovren does very well to crash a header clear under extreme pressure.-- Russia make a substitution: Dzyuba out for Gazinsky.-- Strinic is substituted out for Pivaric.-- Russia make a substitution: Cheryshev, after scoring a stunner, is out for Smolov.-- Substitution for Croatia. Perisic makes way for Brozovic.-- Perisic hits the bar!! There's chaos inside the Russian box and the ball falls to Perisic who takes a touch before drilling a low shot towards the left.. and to the bottom of the post then rebounds across the goal and away from danger!! How close was that?-- Russia substitution: Samedov on for Erokhin.-- Kramaric with an overhead kick from the edge of the Russian box. Akinfeev claims it easily and launches it long. So long that with one bounce, it nearly sailing over the head of Subasic who backpedals to claim the ball.: It's all square between Croatia and hosts Russia at the Fisht stadium with goals from and Kramaric at either ends. The match has otherwise been uneventful. Russia opened the scoring with a Cheryshev wondergoal in the 31st minute, which, to be honest, came out of nowhere. The Villareal brought the ball from deep, played one-twos with Dzyuba down the inside-left channel, received the ball and curled a powerful shot into the top left corner from 25 yards. Croatia got a goal of their own within seven minutes after a good team move and some terrible defending from the Russians. Manduzkic wandered into the box, looked up and picked out Kramaric who sort of crouched to steer a header across Akinfeev and into the bottom right. There's nothing to separate the two teams, not even a goal. You'll have to wait till the second half to know who faces England in the semis.-- Kramaric scores and it's level! Mandzukic wanders into the box, looks up, and picks out Kramaric, who bends down to steer a header across Akinfeev and into the bottom right. A lovely team goal.-- Strinic gets a yellow card.-- Cheryshev scores a screamer!! And it comes out of nowhere. Cheryshev brings the ball from deep, plays one-twos with Dzyuba down the inside-left channel, receives the ball and curls a powerful shot into the top left corner from 25 yards. The goalkeeper doesn't even move! Stunning!  Minute 17 -- Fernandes races down the right and meets a ball at the byline, pulling it for Strinic who seems like he too was surprised by the pullback. He nonetheless takes a touch down the inside-right and is past a defender but the Croatian keeper is off his line to clear the danger.  -- Free-kick to Croatia from a dangerously close range after Rebic is brought down. Rakitic on the ball who puts it up and over the bar.-- Rakitic strings a pass to Vrsaljko on the right who drives a low cross into the centre where Mandzukic is lurking. But the cross is Ignashevich who clears.  Minute 5 -- Croatia have their first attempt after Rebic wins a battle with Kudraiashov to the right of the Russian goal and takes a shot from a tight angle. Croatia get a corner.  Minute 4 -- Dzyuba takes a crack from inside the box but it's blocked out for a corner by Lovren.    Minute 1 -- Russia start pressuring Croatia from the very beginning. Dzyuba gets on th eball and plays Cheryshev in the inside-right. Cheryshev takes a shot but it's blocked.  There are two men in Russia's XI who could put a little pressure Harry Kane's about to get the Golden Boot. Arten Dzyuba and both have three goals to their name; another one or two tonight would see them close the gap on England’s striking sensation. Luka Modric is Croatia’s leading scorer in this tournament with two.This is the third time in five World Cup campaigns that Croatia have faced the hosts at the tournament. The positive news for Russia is that they lost on the previous two occasions, against France in 1998 and Brazil four years ago.Croatia have faced the host nation at the World Cup twice previously, losing both matches against France in 1998 (1-2 in the semi-final) and Brazil in 2014 (1-3 in the group stage).

(Source: OptaJoe)    War of words  Russia defender on Friday said the upcoming 2018 FIFA World Cup quarterfinal game against Croatia would be difficult yet interesting, comparing the Balkan team to Spain's.  In its last-16 match earlier this month, Russia sent Spain home when they won 4-3 in a penalty shootout after a 1-1 draw, reports Efe.  ""Croatia has the same level of quality as the Spaniards but both teams play differently. It is a great team with high-level players in every position,"" he said, adding: ""We have been training hard for a long time, which is why I think we deserve where we are at.""  The defender, who started in three of his team's four games since the beginning of the tournament, said he would watch Brazil's match against Belgium on television.  Croatia's President arrived on a chartered flight from Zagreb to Sochi, where she is to attend the FIFA World Cup quarter-final match between on Saturday.  The Croatian president came with a large delegation of Croatian fans. They flew on the Leoleta -- a Boeing 777-300 plane of the Rossiya airline, which carries the image of the Far Eastern leopard. Earlier several more charter flights from Zagreb arrived in Sochi, reports Tass news agency.  A strong and compact Croatia will fancy their chances against surprise package and hosts Russia when the two sides clash in a FIFA World Cup quarter-final tie on Saturday.  Croatia, basking in the afterglow of their golden generation of footballers, will be targeting the World Cup semi-finals for the first time since 1998 -- when they made their debut as an independent nation on football's biggest stage.  In 1998, Croatia finished third in the World Cup with a team considered to be their best-ever side. If they win against Russia, this Croatian team will join them in the history books.

Rakitic and Rakitic have also been protecting defenders and Domagoj Vida.  Rebic, along with Andrej Kramaric and Ivan Perisic may feature ahead of the midfield duo of Modric and Rakitic. will lead Croatia's attack. In case, Croatia go with three-man midfield, one of and Marcelo Brozovic may get a place.  Until their dramatic penalty shootout win against in the last round, the Croatians hadn't progressed past the last 16 since 2008. They will believe now they that can equal the 'Class of 98'.  Zlatko Dalic's side showed what they got by dismantling Lionel Messi's Argentina 3-0 during the group phase.  ""We have shown in this World Cup that we have the right to hope for big things. We are playing really well and we have such players that we certainly should believe can go to the very end,"" defender Domagoj Vida was quoted as saying by various media outlets.  Croatia will pin their hopes on Real Madrid star Modric who has possibly been the best midfielder at the tournament.  Sixteen of Dalic's squad play in Europe's big five leagues, with Monaco goalkeeper Danijel Subasic the hero against when he saved three penalties.  Coming to Russia, most of the host nation's supporters believe that their last 16 win against Spain as a minor miracle as the hosts had just 25 per cent of the ball, but soaked up the Spanish pressure to win on penalties.  Croatia will present a similar challenge to the Spanish, with a tidy passing midfield, but the Croatians are more direct and Russia will have to defend as well as they did against Spain and maybe even better.  The return of Alan Dzagoev should give them a bit more creativity in the middle of the pitch.  While their defence has looked shaky on occasions, Russia has genuine quality in attack. Spain will be wary of the threat posed by Artem Dzyuba, Denis Cheryshev, and  Mario Fernandes, Sergei Ignashevich, Fyodor Kudryashov and Ilya Kutepov are expected to feature in defence.

All three preceding games went to extra time.  ———  6:18 p.m.  France has scored with the first real chance of the World Cup final as Mario Mandzukic headed a free kick into his own net.  Antoine Griezmann swung the free kick into a mass of French and Croatian players and Mandzukic diverted the ball into the net, just past goalkeeper Danijel Subasic's outstretched hand in the 18th minute.  It was the 12th own goal of the World Cup, an all-time record, and the first ever in a World Cup final.  It was the first goal in regulation in a World Cup final since 2006 — the 2010 and 2014 finals were both extra time 1-0 results  ———  6:05 p.m.  French fans have packed the Paris fan zone, which holds 90,000, near the Eiffel Tower to watch the World Cup final between France and Croatia.  Orio Hamra from the Paris region says, ""Yes, I have faith ... They're hungry and 20 years on, it would be beautiful if they won the Cup."" Les Bleus' last World Cup victory was in 1998.  It was an occasion for all ages to dress up for France, some wrapped in French flags, others painting their faces or donning elaborate headgear in the blue, white and red national colors.  Security forces are on the ready throughout France, which celebrated Bastille Day on Saturday, with 110,000 police on duty.  ———  6 p.m.  Croatia's Mario Mandzukic has taken the kickoff for his team in the World Cup final against France.  As their national anthem rang out around the Luzhniki stadium, Croatian fans unfurled a banner reading, ""one heart, one strength, my country Croatia.""  Both teams were unchanged from the lineups that won their semifinal games. France beat Belgium 1-0, and Croatia beat England 2-1 in extra time.  Croatia is playing its first World Cup final. France won its only World Cup title when it hosted the tournament in 1998.  ———  5:54 p.m.  The French and Croatian teams are on the field for their World Cup final.  The teams emerged from the dressing rooms to stand behind the World Cup trophy, with captains Hugo Lloris and Luka Modric in the lead.  Philipp Lahm, Germany's winning captain in 2014, earlier brought out the World Cup trophy with Russian model Natalia Vodianova. Lahm picked up the cup and held it for cheering crowds.  France is aiming to win its second World Cup and first since 1998. Croatia has never before gone past the semifinal stage.  ———  5:50 p.m.  Croatia's president says no matter what happens in the World Cup final, the unexpected success of her small country's hard-working, underdog team means that ""we're a winner.""  In an interview with The Associated Press, Croatian President Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic says she wants her once-warring region to come together to support Croatia in the final and Serbian tennis player Novak Djokovic in the Wimbledon final.  She says ""sports brings people together. People in all of our countries are tired of ideological differences, of going back into the past all the time.""  Ahead of Sunday's final against France in Moscow, she predicts a Croatian victory but says ""whatever happens, we're a winner.""  She has used the victory to raise her country's profile, posing in a red-and-white checkered team jersey at every opportunity — and giving one to U.S. President Donald Trump.  ———  5:35 p.m.  The closing ceremony for the World Cup has started.  The actor and singer Will Smith is among those performing in the brief show before France plays Croatia in the final.  Dozens of people bearing video screens showing moments from the tournament are interspersed among performers dancing in glittery costumes.  ———  5:30 p.m.  President Emmanuel Macron of France has been joined by one of his predecessors, Nicolas Sarkozy, as guests of FIFA to see their national team play Croatia in the World Cup final.  The president of Croatia, Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic, is also among 10 heads of state and national leaders at Luzhniki Stadium.  They have joined Russian President Vladimir Putin, and the presidents of Belarus, Moldova, Gabon and Sudan.  Some western European governments stayed away from the World Cup amid the fallout from the poisoning of a former Russian spy and his daughter in England in March.  The Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, is also here. Qatar hosts the next World Cup in 2022 and the emir attended a handover ceremony at the Kremlin with Putin and FIFA President Gianni Infantino earlier Sunday.  ———  5:15 p.m.  There was new signage inside Luzhniki Stadium for the championship between Croatia and France.  For the previous six matches, the front of the second and third decks had bright blue backgrounds with ""2018 FIFA WORLD CUP RUSSIA"" in white in English and Russian, alternating with red backgrounds with ""MOSCOW"" and ""(hashtag)world cup"" in white.  For the final, there were gold backgrounds with ""FINAL2018"" in navy blue, alternating with navy blue backgrounds with ""MOSCOW,"" ''FIFA WORLD CUP"" in English and Russian and ""(hashtag)world cup"" on navy backdrops with gold lettering.  ————  5:07 p.m.  France and Croatia are on the field at Luzhniki Stadium to warm up for World Cup final with under an hour to go before kickoff.  France's goalkeeper Hugo Lloris emerged first to cheers from supporters along with his team's two reserve keepers. French fans waved the tricolor as the rest of the team came out, with defender Lucas Hernandez waving to the stands.  Croatian fans gave captain Luka Modric and his teammates a similar greeting minutes later.  France is aiming to win its second World Cup and first since 1998, while Croatia has never before gone past the semifinal stage.  ———  5 p.m.  Russian President Vladimir Putin will help present the trophy to the winning captain after the World Cup final.  FIFA president Gianni Infantino will join Putin for the ceremony on the field at Luzhniki Stadium.  The recent World Cup tradition is for presidents of FIFA and the host nation to jointly hand over the gold-and-malachite trophy.  Four years ago, then-FIFA leader Sepp Blatter and Brazil's then-president Dilma Rousseff presented the trophy to Germany captain Philipp Lahm.  Lahm is bringing the trophy on to the field before France and Croatia kick off at 6 p.m. local time (1500 GMT/11 a.m. EDT) in Moscow.  ————  4:50 p.m.  France and Croatia will take unchanged lineups into the World Cup final.  France coach Didier Deschamps has retained the starting 11 which beat Belgium 1-0 in the semifinals after Blaise Matuidi returned from a suspension in the quarterfinals.  Zlatko Dalic has stuck with Marcelo Brozovic in midfield after he came into the lineup for Croatia's 2-1, extra-time semifinal win over England. That means forward Andrej Kramaric remains on the bench.  Lineups:  France: Hugo Lloris, Benjamin Pavard, Raphael Varane, Samuel Umtiti, Paul Pogba, Antoine Griezmann, Olivier Giroud, Kylian Mbappe, N'Golo Kante, Blaise Matuidi, Lucas Hernandez.  Croatia lineup: Danijel Subasic, Sime Vrsaljko, Ivan Strinic, Ivan Perisic, Dejan Lovren, Ivan Rakitic, Luka Modric, Marcelo Brozovic, Mario Mandzukic, Ante Rebic, Domagoj Vida.  ———  4:45 p.m.  Braving rainy weather, Croatian fans are gathering in squares and streets around the country ahead of the World Cup final with France.  Wearing Croatian team jerseys and waving flags, fans have filled up the central square in the capital Zagreb some two hours before the game kicks off in Russia.  Fans have wrapped the square's monument in national red-and-white colors.  Croatian media and officials have described the team's run to the World Cup final as the country's most important sports event ever.  Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic says ""all this has been a wonderful experience ... we should all be happy to be part of it.""  ———  4:30 p.m.  Thousands of fans have filled the historic Grand Place in Brussels to welcome home the Belgium team after its third-place finish in the World Cup.  The Belgian players returned immediately after their 2-0 win over England in the third-place playoff and were first received by King Philippe at the royal palace on Sunday before they were taken in an open bus through the sun-splashed center of Brussels where thousands more stood along the way.  The Grand Place only holds 8,000 and was full several hours before the players appeared on the balcony of the gothic city hall to another rapturous round of applause and cheers.  ———  4:15 p.m.  Croatia has arrived for the World Cup final.  The Croats, who will be playing for the title for the first time, arrived at the Luzhniki Stadium a few minutes after the French squad. Luka Modric, the midfielder who is the driving force in the Croatia team, was one of the first to enter the dressing room.  Croatia's best showing before this year was when it reached the semifinals in 1998. But the team lost to host France in that game 20 years ago, and the French team went on to win its only World Cup title.  ———  4:10 p.m.  The France team has arrived at the Luzhniki Stadium for the World Cup final against Croatia.  The team, escorted by five police motorcycles, arrived in a bus with a French flag adorned to the windows on either side of the vehicle.  France coach Didier Deschamps was one of the first off the bus, followed by his players wearing blue training outfits.  France is playing for its second World Cup title after winning at home in 1998. Croatia is looking for its first.  ————  3:55 p.m.  The World Cup trophy has arrived at the Luzhniki Stadium.  France and Croatia will play for soccer's most important title on Sunday, with the winning captain the first to hoist the gold statuette over his head.  According to a video posted by FIFA , the trophy was driven to the stadium and arrived packed in a hard case.  ———  3:40 p.m.  The Croatian president has called on Russians to support Croatia in the World Cup final.  In a video message recorded on a plane and posted to Facebook , Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic says in Russian ""You are great hosts. Support Croatia today. Let's be happy together.""  Dressed in Croatian red-and-white, she then leads a chant of ""Croatia, Croatia, Croatia.""  Croatia's political and football leaders have tried to smooth over relations with Russia after their team knocked the host nation out in the quarterfinals.  After that game, some Russian social media users were angered when Croatia defender Domagoj Vida praised neighboring Ukraine in a video posted online. Vida has apologized for any offense, saying he meant to pay tribute to friends in Ukraine and not to comment on the political tension between Ukraine and Russia.  Grabar-Kitarovic met with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin and praised the country's hosting of the World Cup.  Grabar-Kitarovic says, ""This championship really has been an example for everybody. You not only ensured the fans free movement, but you prevented any kind of incident prevented any kind of expressions that could be characterized as showing hatred.""  ———  3:15 p.m.  The area around Moscow's Luzhniki Stadium is filling up with fans, with less than three hours before the World Cup final kicks off.  Croatia fans appear to have the French outnumbered as their country plays in its first final. France is aiming to win the trophy for the second time after a 20-year wait.  Some Croatia fans have turned up wearing water-polo caps in national colors, something which became a national trend when defender Vedran Corluka wore one following a head injury at the 2016 European Championship.  There are fans from all over the world at the stadium, with the flags of China, Ecuador, Germany, Morocco and England all on display.  ———  3 p.m.  Russian President Vladimir Putin has formally passed the torch to Qatar for the World Cup in 2022.  Ahead of the final in Moscow between France and Croatia, Putin has met at the Kremlin with Qatar's emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani and FIFA president Gianni Infantino.  Putin says Russia's World Cup has been a success and ""I am sure that our friend from Qatar will succeed at holding the FIFA 2022 World Cup at the same highest level.""  Putin ceremonially handed a football to the emir to mark the transfer to Qatar, which will be the first Arab country to host the tournament.  The emir says through a translator that the World Cup ""will be a huge and great festival for all our country.""  ———  2 p.m.  France or Croatia?  One of those two teams will become World Cup champion later Sunday.  The French, who won their only World Cup title at home in 1998, will be playing in their third final in 20 years. The Croats have the chance to win the biggest prize in soccer for the first time.  The match at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow caps a month-long tournament that started with 32 teams playing in 12 stadiums around Russia.  ———  More AP World Cup coverage: https://apnews.com/tag/WorldCup"

France defeated Croatia 4-2 in Sunday’s final match, winning the country’s second World Cup title.  The nation’s first World Cup title came in 1998, when France’s squad defeated Brazil 3-0 at home in Paris. France lost a chance at a second title during the 2006 World Cup against Italy in a shootout.  France managed to keep ahold of its narrow lead in the first half of the game, even after Ivan Perišić scored Croatia’s first goal.  But Perišić also gave France the chance to take back its lead. His handball penalty gave France a free kick, in which Antoine Griezmann scored France’s second goal of the match.  This was Griezmann’s fourth goal of the 2018 World Cup.  Antoine Griezmann!

Les Bleus led from the get-go courtesy of the first-half own-goal off the top of Mario Mandzukic's head. Croatia rallied to equalize with a terrific left-foot strike by Ivan Perisic; however France took the lead right back when Perisic handled the ball in his own penalty area.  Argentine referee Nestor Pitana initially didn't call the handball but awarded the spot kick after a video review – the first time in a World Cup final. Antoine Griezmann converted the penalty to put France back in front.  The match was temporarily disrupted when four pitch invaders ran onto the field in the 52nd minute before being dragged away by security and police.  Punk rock group Pussy Riot quickly claimed responsibility for the pitch invasion via social media, saying it was a protest aimed at ending illegal arrests of protesters and to allow political competition in Russia.  Play resumed and France quickly took a 4-1 lead with goals from Paul Pogba and Kylian Mbappe in the 59th and 65th minutes.  Mbappe, at 19 years old, became only the second teenager to score in a World Cup final. He showed his electrifying speed before slotting a right-footed shot past Croatia goalkeeper Danijel Subasic. He was born months after France won the World Cup in 1998.  The last teenager to score in a World Cup final was Pele, who scored two when Brazil beat Sweden 5-2 in 1958.  Pele congratulated the teenager on Sunday, praising him for his performance.  ""Only the second teenager to have scored a goal in a #WorldCupFinal! Welcome to the club, @Mbappe - it's great to have some company!” he wrote.  PUSSY RIOT ACTIVISTS STORM FIELD DURING WORLD CUP MATCH  Mandzukic pulled one back for the Croatians in the 69th after a mistake by French goalie Hugo Lloris.  President Donald Trump tweeted his congratulations to the French National Team soon after the game ended.  “Congratulations to France, who played extraordinary soccer, on winning the 2018 World Cup. Additionally, congratulations to President Putin and Russia for putting on a truly great World Cup Tournament -- one of the best ever!” he wrote.  In France, crowds packed the lawns stretching out beneath the Eiffel Tower, frenetically waving French flags as police struggled to keep them squeezed in place.  On the other side of the Seine River, more throngs poured onto streets around the Champs-Elysees and the Arc de Triomphe, where soldiers and military equipment paraded a day before on France's national Bastille Day holiday.  Croatia was playing in its first World Cup final.  The Associated Press contributed to this report."

Perisic had been the decisive player in this ferocious game, but not always in the way he might want. He had turned the game one way, with a brilliant goal, dragging Croatia deservedly equal. Then he turned it back the other, giving away the penalty that put France back ahead just before the break.  Even when the game ran away from his exhausted team, Perisic was putting more into it than anyone else. Never accepting a hiding place just because his body is crying out for a rest. Never stopping performing even when he has nothing left to give. It was a display that summed up all of Croatia’s best qualities, their bravery, commitment and selflesness. And his decline, as the game got away from him, encapsulated why the game went the way it did.  Because this was a final that was always going to be decided by physical energy. There is not much difference between the teams for experience or quality or motivation. But who could keep going out there the longest, the fastest, at the end of an exhausting tournament, in this humidity cauldron on the outskirts of Moscow.

Getty Images  That was where Croatia lost the game: tired in the first half, exhausted in the second, unable to keep playing their game, to keep resisting. Modric is Croatia’s director, but Perisic is their enforcer. Their top scorer - this was his third goal of the tournament - one of their indisposable men.  In a team built around midfield nuance, Perisic is an athlete. He barely looks like a winger, far taller and broader, a weapon for Croatia to use when they get near the box. Remember the semi-final here on Wednesday night, when Perisic kept Croatia in the World Cup because he could stretch that long body further than anyone else. Away from Kieran Trippier, past Kyle Walker, one long taut leg enough to beat Jordan Pickford and turn the game Croatia’s way.  Then, in extra-time, it was Perisic winning that header on the edge of the box that set up Mario Mandzukic to score the winner. Because there is no such as a lost cause in the 110th minute of a World Cup semi-final.  Perisic began this game like a man who had given everything he had for his country four days ago. His team-mates kept giving him the ball, but he struggled to ever give it back. He lost a 50-50 to Benjamin Pavard. He scuffed a cross straight to Raphael Varane. He ran into Kylian Mbappe and skewed the ball out of play. Even this model athlete could not find the energy within himself.  So how do you react? Perisic could have retreated within himself, played a more low-key game, hinted to his manager that if he wanted Mateo Kovacic or Andrej Kramaric on, that he should be the man to make to make way. And nothing much would ever be written about his final again.  But that is not who Perisic is. He reached deep within himself to drag the game his way. No need for a hiding place. When a bouncing ball was teed up to him just outside the box, he was face to face with Ngolo Kante, the sharpest defensive midfield in football. It takes a lot to make Kante look slow, or clumsy, or in any way misguided or negligent in how he patrols his zone, but that is just what Perisic did.  Shifting the ball sharply inside with his right boot, he left Kante glued to the spot, darted to his left and drove it towards goal, skipping off Raphael Varane’s thigh and into the bottom corner. It was the greatest World Cup final goal for a generation.  But having stayed part of the game, Perisic could not opt out of it now. Him and his tired body were locked into it, whatever the consequences. Defending a corner at the back post, just before the break, Perisic did not react quick enough. The ball bounced off his hand, and in any other World Cup but this one he would have gotten away with it. But the France players appealed, Nestor Pitana eventually agreed, and France were back ahead. No hiding place in a final, no hiding place with VAR.  The sad story of the second half was that neither Perisic nor his team-mates had enough left in their legs. When Perisic surged down the left, reaching the by-line one last time, he skewed his cross over Mandzukic’s header. France went down the other end, faced no resistance, and scored, and then they scored again. Perisic never stopped trying, and was brave enough to try to wrestle Pogba for a loose ball deep into added time, running to pick it up and speed up Hugo Lloris’ goal-kick, when the game was already lost.  But some football matches are so big that they transcends the result itself. That is why the claim that no-one remembers second place is such nonsense. There have been some heroic World Cup runners up in the past - Hungary 1954, Holland 1974 - and this Croatian team can take as much pride as either of them. They may not have re-imagined the game tactically or aesthetically, but they have showed us the furthest limits of what it means to play football as a team.  Modric is already an immortal footballer for this summer, and his time at Real Madrid. But here in this final Perisic made his own case, forcing his tiring body around the pitch, nearly rescuing his own team with a remarkable goal, emptying himself of all physical and mental energy, knowing it would leave him broken at the end.

The FA was punished after “several members” of Gareth Southgate’s squad defied orders to stop wearing the British-made TRUsox at the tournament.  Raheem Sterling, Dele Alli and Eric Dier have all been pictured in the product during England’s run to the semi-finals.  Luis Suarez and Gareth Bale also use TRUsox, which feature non-slip pads and are designed to be worn on top of regular football socks to stop players’ feet moving around in their boots.  Fifa’s crackdown on the socks is being seen against the background of its commercial deal with Adidas, which is one of the governing body’s biggest sponsors."

FIFA is cracking down on television broadcasters focusing on good looking female fans while airing the 2018 World Cup, an official said this week.  Federico Addiechi, FIFA’s head of sustainability and diversity, announced the move during a press conference ahead of the England v. Croatia semifinal match on Wednesday. Addiechi said the federation has asked broadcasters to avoid cutting away to female fans celebrating during soccer matches.  “We have done it on a case-by-case basis when some cases arose and they were pretty evident,” Addiechi said, according to the Irish Examiner. “We’ve done it with individual broadcasters. We’ve done it as well with our host broadcast services.”  Although Addiechi said that the move is not yet official FIFA policy, he added that the organization plans to “take action against things that are wrong.”  “This is one of the activities that we definitely will have in the future ― it’s a normal evolution,” he said.  Ahead of the World Cup, which began last month in Russia, many worried that homophobia and racism would be rampant. According to anti-discrimination organization Football Against Racism in Europe Network (FARE), the most pressing issue of this year’s tournament is sexism.  “There haven’t been a great deal of incidents of the type we expected,” FARE director Piara Powar told The Associated Press, referring to racist and homophobic incidents.  Powar said there has been a reported 300 incidents of “sexism on the streets.” About 30 of those cases consisted of fans harassing female broadcasters, with half of those involving women being “accosted while on air.”  It’s not uncommon for female broadcasters to be harassed while working at sporting events. The World Cup specifically is notorious for obnoxious fans accosting female broadcasters.  Last month, Julieth Gonzalez Theran, a reporter for Deutsche Welle’s Spanish news channel, was reporting live from the World Cup when she was accosted and groped by a male fan."

FIFA says one Croatia player “displayed unauthorized commercial branding on playing equipment items” during the team’s World Cup semifinal match on Wednesday.  Croatia’s soccer federation had been asked by FIFA to “cease the activity that led to the breach.”  Sweden was previously fined 70,000 Swiss francs ($69,800) for several players wearing the unapproved socks in Russia.  FIFA says one player broke the World Cup marketing rules during Sweden’s quarterfinals loss.  ___  5:15 p.m.  Will Smith loves Cristiano Ronaldo, won’t hear a bad word spoken against Neymar, and accepts Brazil could have done better.  Smith will perform the official World Cup song before Sunday’s final, and was asked how Brazil’s quarterfinal exit compared to his movies.  Smith says “it wasn’t ‘Men in Black’ but, you know, it wasn’t ‘Wild Wild West.’ So it was right there in the middle somewhere.”  Smith shared a lively interview session with Nicky Jam and Era Istrefi, his fellow performers of “Live It Up.”  The Hollywood star laughed when asked how he rated the acting skills of Neymar, who has been the butt of jokes for perceived diving and faking injury in games.  “I’ve been in this business way too long to answer that question,” Smith said. “I think he did a spectacular job. That’s my man.”  The coolest player at the World Cup? “I love Cristiano, I love that dude. He just has impeccable taste and style.”  ___  5:10 p.m.  England coach Gareth Southgate says he wants to make only a few changes for his team’s third-place match against Belgium.  Southgate says “it won’t be exactly the same starting 11 but we want ideally to make as few changes as possible. One or two injuries, one or two with a little illness.”  He hasn’t said who might skip the game and hasn’t guaranteed Jordan Pickford will remain in goal.  Kieran Trippier joined his teammates for training on Friday in St. Petersburg despite being forced off during extra time in Wednesday’s semifinal loss with what Southgate called “a sort of nerve problem tied into cramp.”  Southgate says despite losing to Croatia, England remains motivated by the thought of achieving the nation’s best World Cup finish since victory in 1966.  He says “we have a chance to win a medal at a World Cup which only one English team has ever done so there’s a lot of motivation for us.”  ___  4 p.m.  About 60 Nigerian men who say they have been trafficked into Russia during the World Cup are camping outside their country’s embassy in Moscow asking for help.  Sofiya Dukhovnaya, an activist with the anti-human trafficking group Alternativa, says the men arrived in Russia using a legal loophole posing as World Cup fans.  An agency in Nigeria sold them World Cup fan identification cards that allowed them to enter Russia without a visa and promised them work. But Dukhovnaya says once in Russia, the men realized they had been lied to and their return tickets turned out to be fake.  Nigerian Ambassador Steve Davies Ugbah spoke to the men and promised to provide them with food and shelter while he looks for a way to get them home.  ___  3 p.m.  FIFA president Gianni Infantino says talks over changing the 2022 World Cup in Qatar can ease tensions with regional neighbors.  Saudi Arabia has joined with other Middle East states in enforcing a hostile boycott of Qatar since June 2017.  In recent months, Infantino has supported calls to add 16 more teams to the 2022 tournament - a plan likely to make Qatar share hosting duties because it is building only eight stadiums.  Infantino says Qatar can insist on keeping a 32-team format, though he is “pretty sure that all options will be on the table.”  “Maybe we could bring those who are having difficulties communicating with each other to start dialogue,” the FIFA president said at his only World Cup news conference. “The door is slightly ajar and we will see how it moves on from there.”  The Emir of Qatar is expected to attend the World Cup final on Sunday, and Infantino sat with the Saudi crown prince at the opening game on June 14.  Asked about his in-game chatter with VIP guests, Infantino said: “When we are here we don’t speak about politics, we speak about football.”  ___  2:25 p.m.  The boys soccer team in Thailand rescued from a flooded cave this week has been invited to FIFA’s annual awards event.  FIFA president Gianni Infantino says they will be invited to come to London, where the world’s best player prize will be presented on Sept. 24.  The 12 boys and their coach were asked to attend the World Cup final in Moscow on Sunday. They were unable to accept for medical reasons, after being rescued between Sunday and Tuesday to end a two-week ordeal.  Infantino says FIFA will look at involving the team in another soccer event, possibly in Thailand.  ___  More AP World Cup coverage: https://apnews.com/tag/WorldCup      Copyright © 2018 The Washington Times, LLC."
717,7/13/18,N/A,https://www.nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/13/sports/world-cup/fifa-world-cup-perks-russia.html,"MOSCOW — France’s players had barely finished celebrating their victory over Uruguay in the World Cup’s first quarterfinal when a convoy of black minivans and sedans screeched out of the Nizhny Novgorod Stadium. The passengers were in a hurry. They had about two hours — roughly the length of a soccer match — to make the 200-mile journey to Kazan for the day’s second game.  The vehicles whisked them to the airport, where they boarded a private charter flight. When that jet arrived in Kazan, its passengers were met by another fleet of black vehicles, which drove them at high speed directly into the Kazan Arena. They had made it, but only just. Glasses of Champagne were available upstairs in a suite for anyone who wanted them. After all, it had been a stressful journey.  Two hours later, after Belgium had stunned Brazil, another private flight — the group’s third of the day — returned the passengers to their temporary quarters in Moscow, the opulent Lotte Hotel, where a buffet breakfast for two will set you back more than $100 and where hyper-attentive staff members are quick to deliver tissues on leather platters to any guest caught sneezing.  By the time they settled into their beds, the travelers had had quite the day. Never mind that the group’s presence in either city had not been essential. But one of the perks of being a FIFA Council member is access to the best seat in the house for any game at the World Cup. So why not try to take in two in a day?"

Football’s world governing body revealed it had received a report via its anti-discrimination monitoring system and had opened a case against the Football Association.  Fifa did not disclose the nature of the chants but cries of “No surrender” were clearly audible from the England end of the ground during the national anthem at Wednesday night’s semi-final.  It has also been alleged to the Daily Telegraph that there was some anti-Islamic chanting and Nazi salutes in the same section of the Luzhniki Stadium.  Fifa said: “We can confirm that a report has been filed through the anti-discrimination monitoring system in relation to chants of a possible discriminatory nature by English fans at yesterday’s match.

Pre-tournament concerns that Russia 2018 would be tarnished by homophobia and racism have not materialised but sexism has been an issue.  The anti-discrimination group Fare Network has been working with Fifa to monitor behaviour at and around World Cup games and its executive director Piara Powar said sexism had been the biggest problem at Russia 2018.

celebrate PA 190/190 Going home, goodbye Moscow REUTERS  Speaking to reporters at a press conference on diversity issues before England's semi-final against Croatia, Powar said his team have ""documented more than 30 cases"" of mainly Russian women being ""accosted in the streets"" by male fans but believes the real number of incidents is likely to be ""10 times this"".  He also said there have been several cases of female reporters being grabbed or kissed whilst on air.  When asked what Fifa could do to tackle this, the federation's diversity boss Federico Addiechi said it has been working with the local organisers and Russian police to identify these fans and, when appropriate, they have lost their FAN-IDs and been forced to leave the country.  But he then said Fifa has told its broadcast service to stop zooming in on ""hot women"" in the crowd and has been monitoring what the various national rights-holders have been doing, too.  Asked if this was now official Fifa policy, Addiechi said: ""This is one of the activities that we definitely will have in the future - it's a normal evolution.  ""We have done it on a case-by-case basis when some cases arose and they were pretty evident.  ""We've done it with individual broadcasters. We've done it as well with our host broadcast services.""  He added it was not yet part of a ""proactive campaign"" but said ""we'll take action against things that are wrong"".  It is unclear if Russia's host broadcasters have been warned about their habit of picking out pretty faces, as there was a well-publicised case at the beginning of the tournament involving a glamour model who received considerable attention during Russia's opening game against Saudi Arabia.  In regard to other forms of discrimination, Addiechi and Powar agreed the various measures taken by the authorities - banning orders, diversity training and so on - were successful and the Russian people themselves have been great hosts.  Argentina's FA has received the biggest fine - nearly £80,000 – from Fifa so far this tournament for the crowd disturbances during their 3-0 defeat by Croatia. It is understood more than 20 supporters were identified by the authorities and they lost their FAN-IDs and were sent home.  The Russian FA's diversity officer Alexey Smertin, the former Chelsea midfielder, said FAN-IDs - which are similar to the identification cards Margaret Thatcher proposed as a solution to English hooliganism in the 1980s – will be used in domestic football in Russia from next season.  Powar, however, said he believes football could be more joined-up in how it deals with repeat offenders, such as Croatian fans and their nationalist banners and the homophobic chants popular with fans from Mexico and some South American teams.  ""There is an issue with the continuity of sanctions,"" said Powar, noting that both Croatia and Mexico have been punished by their regional confederations several times in the past.  ""There is a gap there that the FAs and fans have taken advantage of. When FAs are consistent offenders that needs to be taken into account.""

Ivan Perisic headed the ball into the area, the England defence hesitated and Mandzukic drove his finish past keeper Jordan Pickford with 11 minutes of extra time left to earn them a place in Sunday's final against France.  England got off to a flying start when Kieran Trippier curled in a free kick after five minutes to put them ahead and they looked more dangerous throughout the first half.  Croatia took control after halftime and hit back when Perisic got in front of his marker to flick in a high cross from Sime Vrsaljko in the 68th minute.

The Juventus forward netted in the 109th minute to complete a remarkable comeback from a shattered Croatian team and take the small nation of little more than four million people into the World Cup final for the first time in their short history. Kieran Trippier's magnificent early free-kick had seemingly set England on course to reach their first final since they lifted the trophy on home soil back in 1966. But it wasn't to be, as Croatia came roaring back in the second half and equalised through Ivan Perisic before somehow finding the energy to win despite being taken to extra time for the third time in 10 days.

Croatia 0-1 England.  23:59 IST: Harry Kane misses a close-range effort. The English captain looked to lack conviction there, shot twice from close range both failed to get at the back of the net.

Croatia can count on Real Madrid's midfield talisman Luka Modric, named man of the match three times in Russia, but his teammate Andrej Kramaric says England's lack of superstars is what makes them a cohesive unit."

Trippier curled the ball in after five minutes to get England off to a flying start but Croatia hit back when Perisic got in front of his marker to flick in a high cross from Sime Vrsaljko in the 68th minute.  The match is going into extra time.  The winners will play France in the final on Sunday.  Two nations who have been waiting years to put right the bitter memories of World Cup semifinal defeats will face each other on Wednesday in Moscow with the chance to finally go one step further.  England's last appearance at this stage was in 1990 when they lost in a penalty shootout to West Germany in Turin while eight years later, in their first World Cup as an independent nation, Croatia lost to hosts and eventual winners France.  While many outsiders view that unexpected Croatian run to the last four as a great success, inside the country many share the view of the team's then manager Miroslav Blazevic that it was a missed opportunity.  England too left Italy 28 years ago feeling that the team featuring Gary Lineker and Paul Gascoigne could have gone all the way."

We’re gutted, you know. We worked so hard. The fans were amazing. It was a tough game, a 50-50 game. I’m sure there was stuff we could have done better, but we worked as hard as we could. It hurts, it’ll hurt for a while, but we can hold our heads up high. It was a fantastic journey, we got further than anyone thought we could, we’ve just got to learn from it. We created some good chances, being 1-0 up. Maybe we dropped too deep at times. In big games, it’s small margins. There’s a lot we could have done better, but they played well. It’s been great to get to this stage, but we wanted to go on and win it. But we’ve fallen a bit short. It just hurts. It shows we can win knockout games; the next stage is to go one further. We’ve got to dust ourselves down and go again in a couple of years.”"

Get highlights of Croatia vs England, FIFA World Cup 2018 semi-final, here. (FULL FIFA WORLD CUP 2018 COVERAGE)  2:20 AM IST: That’s it from our side, thank you so much for joining us! Do join us for our coverage of the third place play-off and the final. Until then, goodnight and goodbye!  2:15 AM IST: Heartbreak for England fans, but it’s hard to argue that Croatia didn’t deserve it more. They showed up when it mattered the most and England did not look at ease after Croatia equalised. France vs Croatia is the final we shall have.

What a time to score!  1:45 AM IST: Half-time of extra-time and the scoreline remains level.  1:38 AM IST: There has been about as much action in the game as watching paint dry. Hopefully the shoot-out is good at least...  1:30 AM IST: Neither side are taking too many risks at this point. Although given that Croatia have won successive penalty shoot-outs en route to the semis, they’d probably fancy their chances more than England would should it come down to that.  1:25 AM IST: The first half of extra-time is underway! Can either of these sides find a winner now or are we destined for another shoot-out? We shall find out.  1:21 AM IST: Full time and these sides can’t be separated.

Extra time looms...  1:08 AM IST: England are finally showing signs of life but the final ball is sorely lacking at thus point.  1:03 AM IST: The goal has awakened the same Croatian legs that seemed stiff as lead before. Suddenly the adrenaline rush has made them look so much more dangerous.  12:55 AM IST: GOAAAAL! Perisic has equalised from a wonderful header! That came from out of nowhere!  12:48 AM IST: The game continues to be a slow one. Not that England fans will complain.  12:40 AM IST: The half has started in a somewhat sluggish manner. Croatia are playing exactly how you would expect a side that are burdened by the fatigue of playing back-to-back games that didn’t finish in normal time. England are happy so sit back and defend.  12:33 AM IST: The second half is underway. A second goal for England will see them all but seal the game. Croatia need a goal soon.  12:18 AM IST: The referee blows his whistle and England go into the break with a lead. A slender lead, but they are ahead nevertheless. Kieran Trippier’s early free-kick the difference between the two sides. Can Croatia make a comeback in the 2nd half?

Croatia are playing well but lack the final touch.  11:44 PM IST: England have played positive football since the goal.

Kieran Trippier gives England the lead with a fabulous free-kick! That is some way to open your account in the tournament!  11:30 PM IST: The players emerge from the tunnel and belt out their national anthems with pride.

The referee has blown his whistle and we are underway in Moscow!  11:20 PM IST: For many of Croatia’s top players like Luka Modric and Mario Mandzukic, 2018 will likely be the last chance they have of lifting the trophy.  11:10 PM IST: The battle today will be won in midfield. Croatia’s trio in the middle is a solid one. For England, Henderson will have to put in a major shift tonight; he will also require plenty of assistance from Lingard and Alli.  11:00 PM IST: Croatia coach Zlatko Dalic makes one change to the team that beat hosts Russia on penalties in the quarter-finals, with Andrej Kramaric making way for Inter Milan midfielder Marcelo Brozovic. England are unchanged.  10:50 PM IST: Croatia starting XI - Danijel Subasic; Sime Vrsaljko, Dejan Lovren, Domagoj Vida, Ivan Strinic; Luka Modric, Marcelo Brozovic, Ivan Rakitic; Ante Rebic, Mario Mandzukic, Ivan Perisic.

Croatia’s 3-0 win over Argentina in the group stage was a clear signal that the team led by midfield maestro Luka Modric was a real threat with their clever passing and movement.  In their quarter-final clash with Russia, the Croats showed a different side, being willing to slug it out with the Russians for 120 minutes before keeping their cool and winning the shootout in such a partisan atmosphere.  England made an early impression with a 6-1 crushing of Panama in the group stage and then overcame their shootout hoodoo in beating Colombia in the last 16 and looked composed and mature in the 2-0 quarter-final victory over Sweden."

Click to read more A Croatian soccer official will be allowed to watch the team's match from a VIP section on Wednesday despite being convicted last month in a corruption case linked to the transfer of captain Luka Modric. When Croatia beat Russia in the quarterfinals on Saturday, the director general of the country's soccer federation sat in the same row of seats as Croatian President Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic and Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev. Damir Vrbanovic has stayed in office since being sentenced in June to a three-year jail term even though FIFA's disciplinary code bars officials ""convicted of a criminal offense in the past five years.""    However, FIFA says the sentence is not final because the former Dinamo Zagreb director general is appealing to a higher court. ""The evaluation of the position of the person concerned, then, is made only by its national association according to the applicable national law,"" FIFA said in a statement to The Associated Press. The Croatian federation said any other interpretation would be ""unconstitutional and serious violation of his human rights.""

Croatia's compact side will combat England's fast and direct football when they meet in the second semi-final of the FIFA World Cup with both teams aiming to recreate their own history by progressing to the title decider.  England’s last appearance at this stage was in 1990 when they lost in a penalty shootout to West Germany in Turin while eight years later, in their first World Cup as an independent nation, Croatia lost to hosts and eventual winners France.  The Croats, basking in the afterglow of their golden generation of footballers, have reached the semi-finals for the second time in their brief history. They will aim to better the third-place finish achieved by the star-studded squad spearheaded by the legendary Davor Suker at the 1998 edition in France.  England too left Italy 28 years ago feeling that the team featuring and Paul Gascoigne could have gone all the way.  But neither side are in a mood for nostalgia or using the past as motivation.  For England, it is a chance to reach the final for the first time since their World Cup winning campaign at home in 1966, more than a generation ago. They reached the last four stage for the last time in Italy back in 1990.  While Croats are in the semi-finals on the back of two knockout victories over Denmark and Russia via penalty shootouts, England got past Colombia and Sweden in the last two elimination matches.  ""It's the best opportunity that England's ever had, and probably might ever have,"" England defender was quoted as saying by the FIFA's official website.  ""We have shown character, we've shown belief and I think that's what is going to get us over the line in this game. I have to dream. I have to dream big,"" he said ahead of the game at the Luzhniki Stadium.  Croatia have had an impressive campaign at this World Cup. They topped an extremely difficult group that included perennial title contenders Argentina, Iceland and Nigeria.  On the other hand, England's progression to the knockout rounds was far more easy -- they defeated inexperienced sides like Tunisia and minnows Panama before losing to an impressive Belgium.  In Luka Modric and Ivan Rakitic, Croatia have arguably the best midfield in Russia and the presence of star strikers and add some added force upfront.  Modric and Rakitic have also been protecting central defenders and Domagoj Vida, who stand in front of experienced keeper Danijel Subasic.  While left-back Ivan Strinic is certain to start, Croatia's preferred right-back Sime Vrsaljko is yet to fully recover from a knee injury suffered during the game against Russia. His absence would likely hand a start to Vedran Corluka in the center of defense alongside Lovren, shifting Vida to right-back.  Rebic, along with and may feature ahead of the midfield duo of Modric and Rakitic. Mandzukic will lead Croatia's attack. In case, Croatia go with three-man midfield, one of and Marcelo Brozovic may get a place.  Croatia have an experienced squad and will go into the match with the belief of going the distance.  ""I agree Croatia has several more experienced players,"" Juventus forward Mandzukic said.  ""That will help us, but the chances are 50-50, I believe, because everybody deserves to be at the semi-final.""  Mandzukic helps out Zlatko Dalic-coached Croatia as their first defender and they will need his tireless running and his aerial positioning to beat an English team which relies a lot on set-pieces and attacking football.  Playing in a 3-5-2 formation, England are the third youngest team in the tournament and head coach has done his utmost to lower the expectations.  England does not boast of big names this time but there is a sense of bonhomie among the players and in Southgate, they have a coach who understands them.  is the leading goal-scorer in the tournament with six goals to his name and like his tally, most of England's goals have come from corners and crosses from the wings.  Kane will be England's main danger with the support of Raheem Sterling, while attacking midfielders like Ali and Jesse Lingard are good enough to trouble any opposition.  Much of England's attacking prowess has depended on Sterling's sizzling pace, which has also helped them to pose considerable threat on the counter.  There have been a lot of debate about whether Southgate should drop Sterling in favour of as the Manchester City forward is yet to score a goal in Russia. But despite his lean numbers, Sterling remains an important part of Gareth Southgate's team with his clever runs from deep that open up rival defences and the chemistry he shares with his fellow forwards.  Jordan Henderson has been operating well in shielding the defence. With the Liverpool defensive midfielder also having improved his passing game, England are creating a lot of chances.  Harry Maguire, John Stones and will feature in a three-man defence ahead of fast-rising keeper Jordan Pickford, while Kieran Trippier has adjusted his role well as a wing-back, putting in a good shift in defending and joining the attack build-up.  Time: 11:30 PM (IST), 7:00 AM (UK Time), 8:00 AM (Croatia Time)  In the today's 2nd semifinal match, England vs Croatia will take place in Moscow on Wednesday, July 11, 2018 at 11:30 PM (IST).

The country’s march to the semi-finals - where they will face England tomorrow - had been notable for the apparent absence of any bigotry by their supporters, who brought shame on the nation at the last three major tournaments.  But the Daily Telegraph can reveal that, far from having cleaned up their act, Croatia fans have been at it again in Russia.  It can also be revealed that Fifa is fully aware of this but chose to keep quiet about it after controversially letting the Croatian Football Federation (HNS) off with a warning for the display of “political/discriminatory banners” by supporters.  The governing body, which claims to have a “zero tolerance” approach to racism, confirmed yesterday its disciplinary committee had sanctioned the HNS with a secret slap on the wrist following their Group D opener against Nigeria.  But it denied that amounted to a cover-up, stating that its regular announcements of disciplinary sanctions were focused on those “that resulted in fines”, and disclosing a secret warning had also been issued over homophobic chanting by Australia fans during their opening match against France."

That is, if you quote Sir Alex Ferguson. In a match where chances came thick and fast, it was the defence and a defender that separated France and Belgium at the St. Petersburg stadium today. Samuel Umtiti's header goal from a set-piece was the only goal in the match that saw a combined 21 shot attempts. With this win, France enter their third World Cup final in 20 years, and will face either Croatia or England for their second-ever title. For the magnificient Belgium, the World Cup journey hasn't ended just yet. They still have to play for the third spot and as their coach said ""would love to end on a high"".  The first half of the semi-final match had everything you'd want from a football match, except goals. France and Belgium both went at each other's throat, attacking at every available chance but still ended the half goal-less after some close misses and a couple of stunning saves from both the goalkeepers.  Belgium's chance of glory came in the 21st minute when they got a corner which was cleared terribly by France. Alderweireld got the ball, turned and slapped a fierce shot towards the goal only for to make a diving save.  France had a similar chance of their own in the 39th minute when Pavard was slipped a clever pass into the inside right of the box. The right-back wanted to slip in at the near post but Courtois made himself big and the shot flew off his dangling left foot for a corner.  Both the teams had several other chances but either the players were profligate, especially the French players, or they were denied by the brilliance of the ooposition team's goalkeepers. For France, their creative outlets were Hazard and De Bruyne while France threatened on the counter with Mbappe outrunning the Belgian defence time and again.  The tempo though had shifted towards France by the end of the first half. Belgium survived a scare in the 50th minute when Olivier Giroud received a ball in the box, turned and let out a shot only for Vincent Kompany to put a foot out to deflect it for corner. took the corner and floated it inside the box where Umtiti rose above a rather tall to head it in at the near post to score France's opener.  Minutes later, the French had a series of chances to double their lead. It all started witih a counter-attack. Mbappe found Matuidi in an acre of space but Matuidi's shot was blocked. But the French came back again and Mbappe pulled out a back-flick to put Giroud in a goalscoring position but Mousa Dembele blocked the striker's shot.  The Belgians built attacks well and moved the ball forward quite efficiently but in the final third, they kept on putting crosses inside the box, hoping that either Fellaini or Lukaku get at the end of it. None of them did. Axel Witsel made a superb effort in the 80th minute. Hazard made a series of give-and-take passes before going down outside the box under a challenge. The balls fell to Witsel who hit a first-time swirling shot that Lloris managed to keep out.  Belgium continued with their crossing game and a glorious chance came in the 88th minute when De Bryune put in a fantastic cross into Lukaku's path which Umtiti, trying to intercept, missed but so did Lukaku. The Belgian striker, who had otherwise been prolific throughout the tournament, was wasteful in front of the goal in this game. The French didn't score very high either in terms of accuray but Umtiti's header meant they could book a place for the final at the Luzhniki Stadium.  Belgium performed admirably and had their fair share of chances. But in most cases, they failed to take those opportunities and in others was a wall. ran circles around the Belgians while drew fouls until he couldn't anymore and had to be susbtituted while kept cutting out the final supply or heading the close-ones out. As the scoreline would suggest, the semi-final match was a close-affair and contrary to the number of goals scored, was a highly attack-minded with both the teams carving chances after chances.  Martinez's highly-talented Belgium squad had not lost their last 21 games but now when they do, they lose the chance to win the World Cup trophy, but they can take a lot of heart from their performance in this match. This squad has shown that these talented individuals can, in fact, be brought together and trained to conquer the world. And for that, they have time on their side. For now, they must focus on their match for the third place.  Here are the live updates:    Minute 90 -- Substitution for Belgium: Batshuayi comes on for Chadli.

Read the report here: https://mybs.in/2VoP0Mk  France look to return to the final of the World Cup for the first time since 2006, while the Belgians look to confirm the promise of their 'golden generation' and reach the final for the first time.      Trivia:  -- France and Belgium have faced each other at international level a whopping 73 times, and no team has won more matches against Les Bleus, or scored more goals, than the Red Devils. (Source: Fifa.com)  -- Benjamin Pavard has yet to lose a match representing his country, whatever the age category (U-19s, U-21s and seniors - 29 games in total) (Source: Fifa.com)  Coach Deschamps says France can get even better The Belgians have won all five of their matches in Russia, scoring 14 goals and leaving Brazil and Japan by the wayside. In the quarter-final against Brazil, they showed their adaptability and in the last 16, they showed their resilience by fighting back from 0-2 down against the Japanese.  France head coach views Tuesday's FIFA World Cup semi-final against Belgium as an opportunity for his footballers to take another step towards fulfilling their full potential.  Two years ago France lost the 2016 European Championship final to Portugal. Now they have the chance to book another final appearance although Deschamps prefers to look on the game as another opportunity for success, rather than atonement for the past, reports Xinhua news agency.  ""All I am going to say now is that we are in the semi-final and we have the chance to play in the final of the World Cup, so let's try to do everything. Tomorrow we have to give everything to get there,"" said Deschamps at the pre-match press conference.  France has a young team with players like and and the coach believes that despite recent success, they can continue to improve.  ""The potential is there, the individual quality is there, this side is younger than the side that was in the final of Euro 2016 but they have a lot of club experience at (a) high level,"" he explained.  ""We will be more competitive. In two and four years, we have a lot of players who will still be here with us. There is potential for progression and this experience here should help them,"" said the French tactician who captained his country to the 1998 World Cup glory.  Deschamps said France rested four players in training as a ""precaution"" but that he had a full squad for Tuesday.  ""Maybe I am in the right place at the right time and we all work hard, but the game belongs to the players, the manager has his role, but it is different,"" he said.  Belgium coach has shown that he can make changes to his system, using a 4-3-2-1 for most of the tournament, but adapting to a 4-3-3 to exploit Brazil's weaknesses down the flanks.  Martinez has succeeded where his predecessors failed by making the team greater than the sum of its parts. The Spaniard has shown great tactical pragmatism by setting up his side to suit the characteristics of his best players and exploit the weakness of opponents. This was exemplified in the team's 2-1 quarter-final victory over Brazil, when was deployed as a false nine while Romelu Lukaku and Eden Hazard were pulled wide.  It remains to be seen what system he will use against a French side that is rock-solid in midfield. One change forced on Martinez is at right-back where he will have to find a replacement for the suspended The most likely candidate is Celtic's Dedryck Boyata.  Martinez dropped forward Dries Mertens against Brazil and fielded Nacer Chadli, who had scored the injury-time winning goal against Japan. Other midfield options include Marouane Fellaini, Axel Witsel and  The French drew one group game (against Denmark), but their World Cup has been one of constant progression built around goalkeeper Hugo Lloris, central defenders and Samuel Umtiti, and midfielders, N'golo Kante and  Olivier Giroud provides a focal point in attack. Add to that the pace of and Antoine Griezmann, who will also drop back to help in the middle and has a team without any apparent weaknesses.  If Belgium persists with three central defenders, Deschamps will look to full-backs and Benjamin Pavard to push forward and look to exploit spaces between the Belgian defensive trio of Vincent Kompany, Toby Alderweireld and Jan Vertonghen.      France captain Hugo Lloris speaks:  ""Belgium are the most complete team of this competition, in all aspects of the game: they defend, attack, counter-attack, they're strong in the air and on the ground. To beat them, we'll have to play a great game"".  Royal presence in the semi-final game:  French President Emmanuel Macron and King Philippe and Queen Mathilde of Belgium will come to St. Petersburg stadium to support their national football team during the game.  ""King Philippe and Queen (Mathilde), as well as Minister of Foreign Affairs Didier Reynders, will arrive in St. Petersburg to support the national team,"" an employee of the Belgian Consulate General in Russia's second-largest city said on Monday, Sputnik news agency reported. France will have to be wary of Eden Hazard and Kevin De Bruyne's pace on the break. Martinez and his players have already shown they can change their formation depending on their rivals and Tuesday promises to be an absorbing tactical battle.  Key match facts: Belgium vs France  France have won all three of the previous meetings at major tournaments, including two World Cup encounters.  The French won 3-1 in the first round of the 1938 World Cup, which they hosted, and 4-2 after extra time in the third-place play-off in 1986. The latter game in Puebla, Mexico, is the most recent competitive match between the sides.  France also beat Belgium 5-0 in the group stage of the European Championship in 1984, with Michel Platini scoring a hat-trick in Nantes.  Belgium are unbeaten in the last three friendly games (W1, D2), winning the most recent encounter 4-3 in June 2015. Marouane  Fellaini scored twice in that game as the Belgians raced into a three-goal lead inside 50 minutes.  This will be the 74th match between the sides. Belgium have claimed 30 wins, with 24 victories for France and 19 draws.  Tactical analysis: Belgium vs France  The first world cup semi-final pitches Didier Deschamp's France against the Belgium of France have stuck largely with their 4-2-3-1, though this has an asymmetrical quality, with either or Corentin Tolisso playing on the left-hand side of the attacking midfield three. Kylian Mbappe is the danger man, while France's full backs push high, especially Benjamin Pavard on the right in the space left by Mbappe, While n'Golo Kante covers and drives forwards from a deep midfield role. Against them, Belgium have used a 3-4-2-1 and, against Brazil, a 4-3-3 in defence which moved to a 3-4-3 in possession.  Normally, the back three is flanked by wing-backs and Yannick Carrasco, while Romelu Lukaku leads the line ahead of Dries Mehrtens and Eden Hazard. Kevin De Bruyne pulls the strings from a deep midfield position, but against Brazil, de Bruyne played as a false nine, flanked by Lukaku and Hazard, ahead of a midfield three - this allowed Belgium to target Brazil's left flank and set up one on ones when countering. Because is less of an attacking outlet than Marcelo, Lukaku is unlikely to play on the right again - de Bruyne might play higher, though, with Hazard. While France's team and shape and selection are unlikely to spring a surprise, Belgium's still could. Both teams have decisions and areas they can target.  Romely Lukaku has been superb so far this tournament. As well as scoring four goals, his all-round contribution has been immense, aware and intelligent in his link-up play. He may fancy his chances against Raphael Varane and Samuel Umtiti. Varane is a quick and elegant defender, but Lukaku can push him physically.  Umtiti can a little rash, pushing forwards, and if Belgium can drop players into space in front of him, Lukaku could exploit any gaps that appear. He is unlikely to start on the right again but could drift out there, again to target the space between Hernandez and Umtiti. started against Brazil on the right of a midfield three in defence, tucking inside when Belgium pushed forwards in possession to allow to overlap.  His aerial ability is well known and, indeed, Fellaini often looks best, as against England in the groups, as a kind of an attacking midfielder. From here he can push up late, unsettle the build-up from deep by man-marking the defensive midfielder, and act as an out ball for long passes. Against Kante especially, this could work well.  France does have other means of transitioning, but Fellaini pushed high would be a handful. It also allows Belgium a second target for long passes against the French press, which could be vital in relieving the defence. Belgium have has issues down the left-hand side.  is not a natural wing back and this has meant that either Jan Vertonghen is caught trying to mark a huge swathe of space out wide, or the opposition gets a free run down in behind Carrasco. This was solved, in part, by Martinez when he switched to a back four against Brazil, but Vertonghen is not a natural left back either and tucked in when Belgium had the ball.  Two sides who have looked exceptional at times in the attack, but who have also offered chances to their opponents - this semi-final will come down to who can exploit those weaknesses more clinically.

Unfortunately for us the difference was a deadball situation. The game was as expected very close, very tight. It was going to be decided by whoever could find that final touch in the box or a bit of luck in front of goal. The effort from the players was magnificent, I couldn’t ask for more. In football, you have to understand there are winners and losers but if you are going to lose, you do it while giving everything. Now we need to get rid of this disappointment and make sure we finish on a high. These players don’t deserve to leave the tournament with a bad taste. We can’t be anything other than disappointed now but we will try to finish the tournament on a high'"

Goalkeepers Hugo Lloris and Thibaut Courtois both made smart saves to make sure an intriguing game remained scoreless at the interval. Belgium pushed hard for an equaliser after conceding but Roberto Martinez watched on as his team suffered their first defeat in 25 outings, ending their hopes of winning the tournament for the first time in history as their so-called golden generation came up short. Get highlights of France vs Belgium, FIFA World Cup 2018 semi-final, here.  1:35 AM IST: That’s it from our side, thank you so much for joining us! Do join us tomorrow for more coverage of the tournament. Until then, goodnight and goodbye.  1:33 AM IST: This France team were always considered a threat but many thought their inexperience might count against them. However, they have been a top side and deserve their moment to shine.  1:28 AM IST: France’s game plan towards the end of the game might have seemed rudimentary, but it made sense to look to not concede. Belgium played well, but lacked the finishing touch in front of goal.  1:25 AM IST: That’s it! France have entered the final for the first time since 2006! And deservingly so, I might add! Heartbreak for Belgium, but it is what it is.  1:23 AM IST: France have largely wasted time but they have made a few chances, none of which they’ve come close to taking.  1:18 AM IST: 6 minutes added on.  1:14 AM IST: Belgium win a free-kick but De Bruyne’s delivery is cleared out. It gives the midfielder a chance to line up again and his cross just about evades Lukaku.  1:10 AM IST: 8 minutes left for Belgium to find an equaliser.  1:06 AM IST: France win a free-kick on the right wing. Griezmann’s delivery is good but Pogba’s header goes over.  1:03 AM IST: De Bruyne gets some space to shoot but his effort goes well over.  1:00 AM IST: Belgium are being patient in possession for now but Mertens has looked a threat since coming on and his crosses from wide  12:55 AM IST: The game has not dropped in intensity in the slightest. Belgium are threatening while going forward and France and only to happy to break at speed when they have the chance.  12:50 AM IST: Eden Hazard enters the book. Meanwhile, Mertens puts in a wonderful cross that Fellani heads just wide.  12:45 AM IST: Belgium making an attacking substitute now. Dries Mertens comes on for Mousa Dembele.  12:42 AM IST: Belgium look shook now. France are camped out inside the penalty area and Giroud gets a good shot in but it’s blocked.  12:38 AM IST: GOAAAAAL! Samuel Umtiti heads France ahead from a corner! He beats Fellaini in the air and powers his header into the goal.  12:35 AM IST: Witsel aims a lovely cross into the box but Lukaku’s header goes over.  12:33 AM IST: The second half is now underway. Can anyone break the deadlock or are we destined for extra-time and maybe penalties? We shall find out soon.  12:18 AM IST: Half-time arrives and the game is now goalless. But what an amazing half that was.  12:13 AM IST: After a quiet few minutes France win a free-kick in a dangerous position. Sadly, Griezmann can only hit the wall.  12:08 AM IST: For all the action that this half has seen, it’s surprising to see the scoreline still remain unaffected.  12:04 AM IST: Giroud now misses a golden chance after Mbappe lays it off for him but the big striker loses his footing anf the shot is tame.  12:00 AM IST: France get a free-kick and the delivery from Griezmann is good. Giroud’s header goes slightly over.  11:56 PM IST: France steadily make inroads into the Belgium box and Matuidi’s run looked to have had them in danger but he overran the ball and it went out of play for a goal-kick.  11:52 PM IST: Remember what I said about Courtois being the busier of the two keepers? I take that back. Lloris is having his goal peppered with shots and he’s saving them like Neo in The Matrix movies so far. It’s been a thrilling first 20 or so minutes.  11:48 PM IST: OH SO NEARLY! Matuidi unleashes a thunderbolt of a shot but it is straight at Courtois and he collects. He’s been the busier of the two ‘keepers thus far. At the other end, Hazard cuts back and unleashes a good shot of his own to win a corner that comes to nothing.  11:45 PM IST: It is now Belgium’s turn to break after winning the ball. De Bruyne leads the charge but his pass is intercepted. Belgium retain the ball and Hazard unleashes a low shot that fizzes wide.  11:43 PM IST: Both teams have the speed to break at pace and France very nearly do so. Pogba releases Mbappe with a through ball but Courtois comes out to snuff out the danger.  11:39 PM IST: The game has slowed down slightly for now but both teams have looked good in the early stages.  11:35 PM IST: Belgium now finding their rhythm in the early parts of the game and they earn a corner. Both teams are looking very fluid.  11:32 PM IST: The game barely kicks off and Mbappe breaks free down the right with a massive surge of pace. Belgium are in for a long night if they can’t stop him from doing that.  11:30 PM IST: The referee blows his whistle and we are underway at Saint Petersburg!  11:25 PM IST: The players have emerged from the tunnel and have lined up for the national anthems.  11:15 PM IST: The key battle today will be between Kylian Mbappe and Eden Hazard. Both have the ability to run at opponents and create chances as well as take them. But the battle between Romelu Lukaku and Antoine Griezmann - both their side’s respective top scorers - will also be worth watching out for.  11:00 PM IST: 30 minutes till kick-off. Today’s game will certainly be a thriller with the amount of quality on display. Kick-off can’t come soon enough!  10:55 PM IST: Both teams making just the solitary change then. The inclusion of Blaise Matuidi certainly strengthens Les Bleus. It remains to be seen how the absence of Meunier and the inclusion of Dembele will affect Belgium.  10:50 PM IST: Belgium starting XI - Thibaut Courtois, Toby Alderweireld, Vincent Kompany, Jan Vertonghen, Axel Witsel, Kevin De Bruyne, Marouane Fellaini, Romelu Lukaku, Eden Hazard, Mousa Dembele, Nacer Chadli  France starting XI - Hugo Lloris; Benjamin Pavard, Raphael Varane, Samuel Umtiti, Lucas Hernandez; Paul Pogba, N’Golo Kante; Kylian Mbappe, Antoine Griezmann, Blaise Matuidi; Olivier Giroud.  10:45 PM IST: Hello and welcome to live coverage of the first FIFA World Cup 2018 semi-final between France and Belgium!
