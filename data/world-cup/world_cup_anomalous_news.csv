The state_„Žs witnesses are Nir Hefetz, a former director of the Prime Minister_„Žs Office and Shlomo Filber, former director of the Communications Ministry.  Hefetz is believed to have provided testimony in all three of the cases in which Netanyahu is a suspect.  Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Free Sign Up  In Case 1000, Netanyahu and his wife, Sara, are suspected of receiving illicit gifts amounting to some NIS 1 million ($282,000) worth of lavish gifts from the Israeli-born Hollywood producer Arnon Milchan and Australian resort owner James Packer, allegedly in return for certain benefits.  Case 2000 involves a suspected illicit quid-pro-quo deal between Netanyahu and Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper publisher Arnon Mozes that would have seen the prime minister weaken a rival daily, the Sheldon Adelson-backed Israel Hayom, in return for more favorable coverage from Yedioth.  The state prosecution is currently considering whether to indict the prime minister in cases 1000 and 2000, after police in February recommended putting him on trial in both on charges of bribe taking.  Case 4000 involves suspicions that Netanyahu, who served as communications minister for several years over his past two terms as premier, advanced regulatory decisions benefiting Shaul Elovitch, the controlling shareholder of Israel_„Žs largest telecommunications firm, Bezeq, in exchange for flattering coverage of the Netanyahus from the Elovitch-owned Walla news site.  Filber signed a deal in February to turn state_„Žs witness and possibly incriminate the prime minister in Case 4000.  Netanyahu and his family have denied any wrongdoing in all of the cases.  Last month, police apparently surprised Netanyahu by making him believe that he would be questioned about Case 4000 and instead focusing on a corruption investigation surrounding the purchase of submarines and naval vessels from a German shipbuilder, known as Case 3000.  It was the first time he had been confronted over the allegations in which several of his key confidants are implicated.  Netanyahu has never been named as a suspect in Case 3000.

Then it posed a threat to a multibillion dollar business.  Television channel beoutQ has been pirating premium sports content and beaming it mainly around the Middle East. Qatar, whose network beIN Sports holds the rights to the soccer games, tennis matches and motor races, said Saudi Arabia is behind the operation. The Saudi authorities denied the allegation and accused the Qataris of a smear campaign.  But away from the trading of accusations, sports organizations are now mobilizing to protect their interests. World soccer governing body FIFA said on Wednesday it would take legal action in Saudi Arabia and is working with other owners of sports rights. It didnt say who it planned to sue.  ÐFIFA urges the authorities of Saudi Arabia and of the different countries where these illegal activities have been observed to support us in the fight against piracy,Ó it said in a statement. The Saudi government welcomed the action and said it would reinforce its Ðrelentless effortsÓ to combat beoutQs activities.  The Spanish league said last week it loses 400 million euros ($469 million) a year to piracy and vowed to take action against beoutQ. Global tennis associations described the channel on July 5 as an Ðindustrial-scale illegal piracy.Ó That was after European soccer body UEFA called on authorities to use Ðall their powerÓ to shut it down.  Selling television rights is the biggest money-spinner for sports competitions from the English Premier League to the NFL. Combined broadcast revenue for Europes top five soccer leagues is worth almost 8 billion euros a year.  Read More: Saudi-Qatar Spat Spills Into Soccer World Cup Broadcast Rights  Failure to act against piracy could mean less money down the line as networks seek compensation or negotiate lower fees, said Marc Ganis, head of the Chicago-based sports business company Sportscorp. ÐThe risk increases significantly the greater the piracy becomes and the more financially attractive markets they penetrate,Ó said Ganis.  Watching the Beautiful Game Four of the five top European leagues get most of their money from TV rights. Source: Deloitte Annual Review of Football Finance 2018  BeoutQ started online in August 2017 and satellite broadcasts began the following month. Its backed by Colombian, Cuban and Middle Eastern investors, according to an earlier version of its website.  The channel shot to prominence in the Middle East in May when it streamed the UEFA soccer Champions League final between Real Madrid and Liverpool in the region, appearing to be a play on the beIN name.  BeIN Sports already has been hit by Middle East politics after Saudi Arabia and three of its allies severed diplomatic, trade and transport links with Qatar in June 2017, accusing the gas-rich peninsula of sponsoring terrorism. Qatar, which is set to host soccers World Cup in 2022, says the boycott is an attempt to subvert its sovereignty.  Profit in the region over the past year was 17 percent lower than projected because of the boycott and piracy, said Tom Keaveny, managing director for the Middle East and Africa at beIN Sports. He didnt provide more details.  BeoutQ has Ðopened Pandoras box,Ó said Keaveny. ÐIf its possible to steal from us, its possible to steal from any broadcaster or rights holder in the world.Ó  FIFAs move comes just days before Sundays World Cup Final between France and Croatia. Despite the pirates, beIn said 1.14 billion cumulative viewers watched the first 12 days of the tournament, up about 100 million since 2014. The next World Cup, in 2022, is scheduled to be held in Qatar where beIN Sports is based.  Sophisticated  Indeed, beoutQ was widely available in Saudi Arabia in the months leading to the World Cup. It was also seen streaming at restaurants and public venues during the tournament.  ÐThe case of beoutQ is especially troubling due to the unparalleled sophistication and the extensive period of time over which the commercial-scale theft has been allowed to continue,Ó the worlds tennis governing bodies said on July 5, describing beoutQ as being based in Saudi Arabia.  The Saudi government has denied any link to the channel and said it has confiscated thousands of devices used to stream content illegally.  Satellite television provider Arabsat carries BeoutQ. While headquartered in Riyadh, Arabsat is an entity affiliated with the Arab League and established by 22 members, the Ministry of Media said in a statement. BeoutQ, it said, is also available in other countries.  ÐSuggesting that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is in any way complicit in beoutQs operation both offends the Saudi people and is a malicious lie,Ó it said. Arabsat didnt answer an email seeking comment.  Read More: Saudis Dismiss Piracy Claim as Soccer Spat Escalates  With beoutQs illegal broadcasts largely confined to the Middle East, the impact on revenue globally may remain limited. But entities such as FIFA are under more pressure to stamp out piracy, even if that means upsetting potential investors.  ÐWhichever way they go will be construed as them making a political statement,Ó Simon Chadwick, professor of sports enterprise at the Salford Business School in England. ÐFIFA is stuck between a rock and a hard place."

Then a garbage truck drove by, swooping dutifully upon bins.  From where I watched, clinging to a high fence, the World Cup final was for Parisians not so much a matter of life and death as joie de vivre and more of it. The day after Bastille Day, even to be there appeared to take them as a pleasant surprise. In the crowd, one wore a Zidane shirt, another Henry_„Žs, but no one yet had a Mbappe. This happy time had come upon them suddenly.  Admittedly, the Marais is scarcely a hotbed either of soccer or the French proletariat. But Le Saint Gervais was typical of the day. For security reasons _„_ always paramount here _„_ only one large public venue was opened, in front of the Eiffel Tower. For everyone else, it was either a muggy living room, or your friendly neighbourhood cafÍ©.  Mine host at Le Saint had rigged up a screen atop seven bar tables and four crates, listing slightly, with an umbrella to shade it from the still bright sun. Patrons sat in the street, crossed-legged, as if at an outdoor cinema, and mostly stayed that way. Can you imagine that in, say, Italy or Spain, or for that matter Croatia? Two buffoons tried to set up their own chairs in the midst of the watchers. They were met with indignation, but neither raised voice nor hand."

He recruited the best architects to transform forlorn Baltic marshland into Russia_„Žs finest city, then and now. St Petersburg became capital of the Russian Empire for two centuries, until Moscow grabbed the title back under communism.  The star tsar is now entombed in the Peter and Paul Cathedral (alongside the murdered family of the last tsar). But his handiwork endures, and will provide plenty of interest while England fans await the Semi Final on 10 July, no doubt involving Gareth the Great and his team.  Touch down  St Petersburg retains its airport code (LED) from back in the USSR days, when it was known as Leningrad. The airport, Pulkovo, retains something of a Soviet atmosphere. It is 11 miles south of the centre; bus 39Ex runs every half-hour to Moskovskaya Metro station, taking 20 minutes for 40 roubles (50p).  Getting around  If you can_„Žt reach it on the Metro, you_„Žre probably better off not going. The magnificent network has a flat fare of 45 roubles (55p), though if you buy a TravelCard, 10 journeys within a week cost 355 roubles (‘£4.25). For elaborate Soviet interpretations of Classical themes, visit Sportivnaya station for ancient Greece and Pushkinskaya for ancient Rome.  In the centre, St Petersburg is eminently walkable.  Check in  I like the Oktyabrskaya Hotel, very close to the Moscow station _„_ opened in December 1851 to welcome travellers arriving by rail to the then-capital of Russia, and for a time known as the Grand Hotel du Nord. Apart from the Semi Final night on 10 July, rates are looking good from as little as 6,413 roubles (‘£76) room only.  A tale of two palaces  At the heart of St Petersburg is the Winter Palace, the Imperial residence which now houses a good chunk of the Hermitage.

This astonishing confection of indulgence was half destroyed by Nazi Germany during the Second World War Siege of Leningrad, but meticulously restored. The expansive grounds are as impressive as the shimmering structures they contain.

They serve massive salmon pies, weighing 1kg, for the equivalent of under ‘£10; bring a friend to help.  If you enjoy a bit of bling with your dinner, then the Gymnasia restaurant will make you feel you are back in the last days of the tsars, as you dine on solid Russian fare.

This has been the best, perhaps the most overused joke of this World Cup among Kerala fans. Its origin can be traced back to their seemingly irrevocable habit of the football-frenzy groups to fill up roadsides, pavements, terraces and any other available open space with huge flex hoardings and banners of their favourite teams and players.  Teams will fall and perish with the progress of the tournament as there could be only one winner, but these hoardings, made of non-recyclable PVC plastic, remain a major source of environmental pollution.  READ | In Kerala, fan clubs spend a minimum of Rs 8,000 on World Cup flex hoardings  The fans know, even if their side lifts the cup or not, a day will arrive sooner or later that these giant boards will be of no use to anyone but for the chickens and hence the joke of housing the chicken.  Former champions Germany was the first hot-property to exit the tournament, soon followed by other favourites like Spain and Argentina. With the exit of Brazil in quarterfinals, the lion's share of flex boards has gone ""orphaned"" with no purpose left to serve.  However, as we edge closer to the finale of the tournament many fans seem to have absolved only the humour and not the essence of the joke - leaving the flexes where they were affixed week before to degrade the surroundings.  This is where two organisations have stepped in with a drive to cleanse Kerala of this hazardous menace in virtuous ways.  ""Handsome flexes for broken rooftops""  Blood Donors Kerala (BDK), a state-wide non-profit organisation that arranges blood for patients and accident victims have asked football fans to give them all fading flexes to make house roofs for the needy. The Kozhikode district unit is pioneering the campaign with the intention to help the residents of the district's slums to have a leak-proofed monsoon.  ""Many fan clubs have contacted us already and have promised to bring the hoardings to our collection point at Gujarati street. We are getting calls from neighbouring districts as well, giving us the confidence to make it a pan-Kerala campaign,"" said Amjad, an executive member of the BDK who is in charge of the programme.  BDK has also decided to organise the second stage of the campaign at the tribal colonies of Wayanad and Nilambur area of Malappuram district.  ""Many regional clubs have been contacting us asking for tips to coordinate similar campaigns in their respective areas. Even college authorities have contacted to know if banners used for seminars are accepted,"" he said.  Amjad added that fans associations of film stars have also pledged to contribute after seeing the post they put up in their official Facebook page.  Kerala's first ""flex bank""  ""One phone call to help earth and man"" is the tagline of ""Flex Bank"" - an initiative by the Alappuzha district committee of the Kerala Sastra Sahitya Parishad (KSSP), an organisation working with to popularize scientific outlook among people.  The KSSP volunteers are aiming to make the joke a reality by collecting as much vinyl flexes as possible and make not just chicken coops but plant bags from them. With the blueprint for the campaign fully prepared, they are considering the FIFA World Cup as the ideal launching pad.  Raising the motto ""Waste is unused wealth,"" KSSP is hoping to bay on public cooperation and government support than their organisational resources for the success of the initiative.  Explaining their course of action, Govind CS, one of the in-charge of the programme said: ""Autorickshaw drivers are a crucial part of this campaign. Our plan is to seek their help to spot and collect old hoardings from different parts of the district and transport it to the district environment office where we are planning to coordinate the rest of the campaign.""  He said the district collector has promised to release a circular, making it mandatory to remove all flex boards within 15 days of establishment. Such a ruling will force the responsible for ways to dispose of their hoardings and that's where the flex bank enters.  ""It is not just associations and shopkeepers who have communicated with us so far but many flex printers have reached to us asking if we will accept waste prints from their shops. Thus good response from all sides are giving us the motivation to proceed,"" Govind said.  PVC which is used for making flex is a dangerous chemical substance as it contains chlorine which will emit dioxin and furan which are highly toxic. It cannot be recycled, but only be burned or dumped.  PVC doesn't degrade easily either and is hence called poison plastic. It leaches harmful chemicals into the soil and finally into the groundwater.  The National Green Tribunal (NGT) had banned the use of flexes, but the directive is yet to be implemented in Kerala."
